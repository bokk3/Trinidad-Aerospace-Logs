# Chapter Two: The Choice

**[T.A.I. Personnel File #2847 - Recruitment Log, Continued]**  
**Decision Period: August 17-20, 2043**  
**Status: Pending**

---

The card sat on my workbench for three days, propped against a carburetor I was rebuilding. Every time I walked past it, Dr. Anika Ramcharan's name seemed to catch the light differently.

*Trinidad Aerospace Institute.*

I'd typed it into every search engine I could think of. Found almost nothing. A few vague mentions in archived news articles from seven years ago about "private investment in Caribbean STEM initiatives." One blurry photo from a trade conference showing Dr. Ramcharan shaking hands with someone whose face was turned away. A defunct website with a placeholder page that said "Under Construction" and nothing else.

For an aerospace company supposedly building next-generation rockets, T.A.I. had less online presence than my blog.

Which either meant they were incredibly serious about secrecy, or I'd been approached by the most elaborate scam in Trinidad's history.

"You're overthinking it," Marcus said, not for the first time. We were in his uncle's garage—the one where I actually worked for money—and he was watching me stare at the card instead of finishing the brake job I'd been paid to do.

"Am I?" I held up my phone, showing him the search results. "Look at this. Nothing. No employee reviews, no project announcements, no government contracts listed anywhere. It's like they don't exist."

"Maybe that's the point." Marcus grabbed a wrench and started working on the brake calipers himself, since I clearly wasn't going to. "You heard what she said. Discretion. Secret facility. They're not exactly gonna have a Instagram page."

"Or it's a front for something else entirely."

"Like what? A drug cartel that recruits through blog comments?" He laughed, but it died when he saw my face. "Come on, man. You saw her. That lady was legit."

"Legitimately what, though?"

Marcus wiped his hands on a rag, leaving new grease stains on top of old ones. "Look, you want my honest opinion? I think you're scared."

"Of course I'm scared. She's asking me to disappear into some underground facility I can't tell anyone about, working on projects I can't blog about, for reasons that aren't entirely clear—"

"You're scared it's real," Marcus interrupted. "You're scared you'll say yes and actually be good at it. Or worse, you'll say yes and realize you're in over your head, and then you can't come back to this." He gestured around the garage. "To us."

I opened my mouth to argue, then closed it. He might have been right.

My phone buzzed. Keisha, finally responding to the group chat where I'd told them about the encounter.

*Sorry, was at lecture. WAIT WHAT. Rockets??? In Trinidad??? Are you SURE she was real?*

I typed back: *Pretty sure. Unless I hallucinated a very specific woman in a very expensive suit.*

*Did you Google her name?*

*Of course. Found one photo, couple mentions. Nothing substantial.*

*Send me everything you found. I'll dig deeper.*

That was Keisha. Give her a computer and a challenge, and she'd find things that weren't meant to be found. I forwarded her all my pathetic search results and went back to staring at the brake rotors like they held answers.

"You gonna call her?" Marcus asked.

"I don't know."

"Yeah, you do. You've already decided. You're just making yourself miserable pretending you haven't."

---

Keisha showed up at my apartment that night with her laptop and a rum punch she'd made herself. She sat cross-legged on my couch and proceeded to tear through digital archives like someone who'd done this professionally.

"Okay, so Dr. Anika Ramcharan," she said, pulling up multiple windows. "Born in San Fernando, 1989. Full scholarship to MIT for aerospace engineering. Graduated top of her class. PhD by 26. Worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for five years on ion propulsion systems—that's legit, by the way. Left to join SpaceX, worked there for three years on Raptor engine development."

"How did you find all that?" I asked, leaning over her shoulder. "I couldn't find anything."

"You were looking in the wrong places. Academic databases, conference proceedings, patent filings—she's all over those. She co-authored a paper on hybrid rocket propulsion that got cited like 200 times." Keisha scrolled through dense technical documents. "Then, seven years ago, she just... vanishes. No more papers. No more conferences. No social media presence. Nothing."

"That's when she came back to Trinidad."

"Must be." Keisha pulled up a grainy photo from a university event in 2036. Dr. Ramcharan looked younger but had the same intense expression. "The question is, why? She had a career trajectory that was going straight to the top of aerospace. Why leave that to build a secret facility in Trinidad?"

"She said certain types of innovation require discretion."

Keisha gave me a look. "That could mean a lot of things. Good things, questionable things, potentially illegal things..."

"You think it's shady?"

"I think it's interesting." She closed her laptop. "I think someone that smart, with that resume, doesn't just disappear for fun. She's building something. The question is whether you want to be part of it."

"The blog—"

"The blog is great," Keisha cut me off. "You've built something cool. But be honest with yourself. Is writing about car modifications what you want to do forever? Or do you want to actually build something that matters?"

"Cars matter."

"You know what I mean." She took a sip of her drink. "Marcus is worried you're going to leave us behind. I'm worried you're going to let this pass because you're too comfortable where you are."

"What would you do?" I asked. "If she'd approached you instead?"

Keisha didn't hesitate. "I'd be terrified. And I'd say yes anyway."

---

That night, I couldn't sleep. I pulled up *Kinetic Vector* on my laptop and scrolled through three years of posts. Physics breakdowns. Drift tutorials. Reviews of modifications. Maps of the city's blind spots. Almost two hundred articles. 

Sixty-three thousand words about momentum and friction and the precise angle needed to maintain control while losing it.

In the comments, people from around the world thanked me. Said my explanations made sense when textbooks didn't. Said I'd helped them understand not just cars, but physics itself. A few said I'd inspired them to study engineering.

But inspiration wasn't the same as actually doing it.

I thought about Dr. Ramcharan in her tailored suit, waiting in a parking garage at 2 AM because she'd read every single post and seen something worth recruiting. I thought about Marcus's comment: *You're scared it's real.*

I thought about rockets lifting off from somewhere in Tobago, pushing against gravity with controlled fire and precise mathematics. About the engineering required to make something that heavy fly that high. About being the person who solved the problems that made it possible instead of the person who wrote about someone else solving them.

The card was still on my workbench in the garage. I'd memorized the number days ago.

---

I called at 11 PM on the third day, figuring if she gave me her direct line, she expected calls at odd hours.

She answered on the second ring. "This is Ramcharan."

"It's, uh, the blogger. From the parking tower." Great start. Very professional.

"I know who you are." I could hear a smile in her voice. "I've been waiting for your call. Though I expected it yesterday."

"I wanted to be sure."

"And are you? Sure?"

I looked around my small apartment. Bare walls except for a poster of a Subaru WRX and a whiteboard covered in force diagrams. My life fit into maybe six boxes if I packed efficiently. Nothing keeping me here except comfort and fear.

"I have questions," I said.

"That's why I'm hiring you. People who don't ask questions are useless in R&D."

"The blog. You said I can't write about T.A.I. But can I keep the blog itself? Post about other things?"

There was a pause. "That would be... difficult. The kind of work we do changes how you think. You'd have to be constantly self-censoring, watching what you reveal. Most people find it easier to step away entirely during their time with us."

"During my time? This isn't permanent?"

"The apprenticeship is two years. After that, we reevaluate. Some people stay. Some move on to other opportunities. A few decide aerospace isn't for them after all." Another pause. "But no one who leaves talks about what they saw here. That's non-negotiable."

"Why the secrecy? If you're building something revolutionary, wouldn't you want people to know?"

"When it's ready, people will know. But innovation in the public eye means innovation under scrutiny. Every setback becomes a scandal. Every experiment needs justification. Every dollar questioned." Her voice took on an edge. "I spent years watching brilliant ideas die in committee meetings. Watching lawyers kill projects that could change everything because the risk assessment looked bad. T.A.I. exists because some work needs to happen away from that noise."

It made sense. It also made me nervous.

"My friends—"

"Can know you're working for an aerospace company. They can know it's classified work. They cannot know where, or on what, or with whom. If you can't lie to the people you care about, this won't work."

I thought about Marcus and Keisha. About drift sessions in the parking tower. About the casual freedom of having nothing to hide.

"What if I'm not good enough?" The question slipped out before I could stop it.

"Then you'll learn." Dr. Ramcharan's voice softened slightly. "I'm not hiring you for what you know. I'm hiring you for how you think. The rest is teachable."

Through my window, I could see Port of Spain spread out below, lights mixing with darkness. Somewhere out there, Marcus was probably working on his car. Keisha was coding something. Life was continuing exactly as it had been.

And somewhere else, hidden beneath this city and across the water in Tobago, people were building machines that reached for orbit.

"When do I start?" I asked.

"Monday. I'll text you the address for the entry point. Arrive at 6 AM. Bring work clothes and an open mind. Leave your phone in your car."

"That's it? No contracts, no background check, no—"

"Oh, the background check started the moment you answered this call. You'll sign approximately forty pages of NDAs on your first day." She sounded amused. "But yes, that's it. Welcome to the Trinidad Aerospace Institute."

She hung up before I could respond.

I sat there with my phone in my hand, staring at the blank screen. My heart was racing like I'd just finished a drift run at full throttle.

I'd done it. I'd actually said yes.

Now I just had to tell Marcus and Keisha that I was disappearing into a world I couldn't explain, working on projects I couldn't discuss, for reasons I didn't fully understand.

I opened our group chat.

*So... I made a call.*

Marcus replied first: *Yeah?*

*Starting Monday. I'm in.*

There was a long pause. Then Keisha: *Holy shit. You're actually doing it.*

*I think I'm actually doing it.*

Marcus: *This is either the smartest or dumbest thing you've ever done and we won't know which for like two years.*

*That about sums it up.*

Keisha: *I'm proud of you. Also terrified for you. But mostly proud.*

Marcus: *We're drifting on Sunday night. One last run before you disappear into your secret rocket lair.*

*It's not a lair.*

*You don't actually know that.*

He had a point.

---

Sunday night came faster than I expected. The three of us met at the parking tower, same as always, except everything felt different now. The weight of what I'd agreed to hung in the humid night air.

Keisha had pushed her curfew to the limit to be there. Marcus had brought beer, which we drank sitting on the hood of his Honda, looking out over the city.

"You're gonna forget about us," Marcus said. Not angry, just sad.

"No way. You're stuck with me."

"You say that now. But you're gonna be working with actual scientists, building actual rockets. What are you gonna want to talk about? Our weekend drift times?"

"Yes," I said firmly. "Because that's still who I am. This doesn't change that."

"Everything changes things," Keisha said quietly. She was scrolling through *Kinetic Vector* on her phone, reading old posts. "You're not going to be the same person after this. None of us are the same as we were three years ago."

"Okay, but I'm still going to be me. Just... a version of me that knows about rockets."

Marcus crushed his empty beer can. "Promise me something. If it gets weird, if they're doing something shady, if you feel like you made a mistake—you call us. We'll come get you."

"From a secret facility you don't know the location of?"

"We'll figure it out. I'm serious. You're not alone in this."

I looked at my two best friends, sitting on a car in a parking tower at midnight, making promises we might not be able to keep. This was my world. This was real.

Tomorrow, I'd step into something else entirely.

"One more run?" I asked, sliding off the hood.

Keisha grinned. "Let's make it count."

We fired up our engines and the sound echoed through the concrete structure, bouncing off pillars and disappearing into the Port of Spain night. For the next twenty minutes, we were just three people who loved cars and physics and the perfect application of both.

The last drift I made before everything changed was a good one. Smooth arc, maintained speed, came out of it with my heart racing and my friends cheering.

I'd remember that feeling. Hold onto it for whatever came next.

As we packed up to leave, I took one last look at the view from Level 7. The city, the mountains, the darkness where jungle reclaimed the land. Trinidad spread out below me, familiar and mysterious all at once.

Tomorrow, I'd see what was hidden underneath.

Marcus pulled me into a hug before we left. "Don't be a stranger, rocket scientist."

"Not a scientist yet. Just an apprentice."

"Same difference." He grinned, but his eyes were serious. "We'll be here when you surface."

*If I surface*, I thought but didn't say.

I drove home through empty streets, my Subaru's engine humming its familiar song. When I parked outside my apartment, I sat there for a moment, feeling the vibration fade.

Tomorrow was Monday. 6 AM. An address I didn't recognize. A world I couldn't imagine.

I went inside, set three alarms, and tried to sleep.

Didn't work. Ended up staring at my ceiling until 4 AM, running through every possible version of what the next day might bring.

At 5:15 AM, I gave up on sleep, showered, dressed in my usual work clothes—jeans, boots, a plain t-shirt. Left my phone on the charger like Dr. Ramcharan instructed.

At 5:45 AM, I was in my car, driving toward an address in East Port of Spain that Google Maps said was an abandoned commercial building.

At 5:58 AM, I found the rusted metal door of the hidden garage, exactly where her text said it would be.

At 6:00 AM, I took a deep breath and knocked.

The door rolled up silently, revealing darkness and a woman in a security uniform who checked my ID against a tablet.

"Welcome to T.A.I.," she said. "Dr. Ramcharan is expecting you."

I stepped through the doorway and heard the metal door roll shut behind me with a finality that made my stomach flip.

No turning back now.

Somewhere ahead, in the darkness I was walking toward, was everything I'd said yes to.

I hoped I was ready.

I hoped I'd made the right choice.

I hoped Marcus and Keisha would forgive me if I hadn't.

But mostly, I hoped that whatever I found at the end of those tunnels would be worth the price of the secret.
