---

The hidden garage looked exactly like what it was pretending to be: forgotten.

Water stains traced abstract patterns down concrete walls that had probably been poured in the 1980s. Fluorescent tubes hummed overhead, half of them flickering with the irregular rhythm of fixtures that should have been replaced years ago. The floor was cracked, with weeds pushing through in corners where no one bothered to spray anymore. A few other vehicles sat in the shadows, sedans, SUVs, nothing remarkable, covered in the fine dust that accumulates when tropical humidity meets abandonment.

It felt wrong. Deliberately wrong. Like a movie set dressed to look like a place nobody cared about.

The woman who'd let me in had already disappeared somewhere into the shadows. I stood next to my Subaru, suddenly very aware that I'd just driven into an unmarked building based on a text message and blind faith.

"First time?"

I spun around. A man had materialized from behind a concrete pillar, or maybe he'd been there the whole time and I just hadn't noticed. He was maybe mid-forties, compact build, wearing dark tactical clothing that managed to look both casual and intimidating. His face was unremarkable in that specific way that made you immediately forget what he looked like. Except for the scar above his left eyebrow.

"Yeah," I managed. "First time."

He studied me with eyes that cataloged details: my posture, my clothes, where my hands were, whether I looked like someone who'd bolt. "Colonel Michael Thompson. Security Chief. You're the blogger."

Not a question.

"That's me."

"Phone stay in the car?"

I nodded.

"Good. Smart watch, fitness tracker, any other connected device?"

"Just the phone."

He pulled out a tablet and tapped something. "Biometric scan. Look here." He held up the device and a soft light flashed across my face. "Now thumb on the pad." I pressed my thumb against the screen. It tingled slightly, probably reading more than just my fingerprint.

"You'll do that every time you enter or exit," he said, returning the tablet to wherever he'd produced it from. "Miss it once, you're locked out until Dr. Ramcharan personally vouches for you. Which she won't appreciate."

"Understood."

"No weapons, no recording devices, no cameras. If you bring any of that in here, even accidentally, you're done. Not suspended. Not written up. Done. Gone. Charges filed. Clear?"

"Crystal."

"Good." He gestured toward a corner of the garage I hadn't really noticed before. There was a door there, industrial gray, with a small sign reading "MAINTENANCE ONLY" in faded letters. "That's your way in. Follow the tunnel. Don't take any side passages, they all dead-end anyway, and you'll just get lost. Takes about fifteen minutes to walk. Elevator's at the far end. Dr. Ramcharan will meet you there."

"That's it?"

"That's it." He paused, and something almost like sympathy crossed his face. "The tunnels are... unsettling. First time especially. If you need to turn back, do it now. Once you're past the halfway point, there's no good place to change your mind."

"I'm not changing my mind."

"Everyone says that." He stepped back into the shadows. "See you on the other side. Maybe."

I wanted to ask what he meant by "maybe," but he was already gone. Just like that. One second there, next second not.

I took a breath, walked to the maintenance door, and pulled it open.

Cool air rushed out, smelling of stone and earth and something metallic. The kind of air that had been circulating underground for a long time. Beyond the threshold was a concrete stairway leading down, lit by a single LED strip along the ceiling. The stairs dropped about twenty feet before leveling out into what looked like a tunnel.

I stepped through and let the door close behind me.

The sound of it sealing, a heavy, pneumatic hiss, felt like punctuation. A sentence ending. The normal world on one side, whatever came next on the other.

The stairs were easy. Concrete, well-maintained despite the aesthetic of abandonment upstairs. My boots echoed in the enclosed space. At the bottom, the tunnel opened up.

Hand-carved bedrock lined the walls in some places, poured concrete in others, creating a patchwork of surfaces that suggested the tunnel had been expanded over time. About eight feet wide, maybe nine feet tall. Cables and pipes ran along the ceiling, some bundled neatly, others looking more improvised. LED strips provided light every ten meters or so, but the stretches between them were dim enough that my eyes had to adjust constantly.

The floor was smooth concrete, slightly damp in places where water seeped through cracks. Small puddles reflected the scattered lights, turning the tunnel into a series of small mirrors.

I started walking.

The first few minutes were fine. Uncomfortable, sure, I'd never been great with enclosed spaces, but manageable. The tunnel ran straight, sloping gently downward. The air was cool and slightly moving, pushed by ventilation systems I couldn't see. My footsteps echoed strangely, the sound bouncing back in ways that made it hard to judge distance.

Then I hit the first turn.

The tunnel curved right, and suddenly I couldn't see the entrance door behind me anymore. Just tunnel stretching in both directions, lit by the same sparse LEDs, looking identical in both directions. If someone asked me right now which way was out, I'd have to guess.

Colonel Thompson's words came back: *The tunnels are unsettling.*

Yeah. That was an understatement.

I kept walking. The slope continued downward, which felt wrong. We were in Trinidad, island, sea level, tropical. How deep underground was this facility? And why would you build down when you could build out?

Unless you were hiding something.

Another curve, this time to the left. The light from the last LED faded before the next one came into view, leaving me in near-darkness for about three seconds. My brain immediately supplied horror movie logic: something could be in that darkness, something could be following, what if the lights go out completely.. 

I forced myself to breathe normally and keep walking at the same pace. Not running. Not panicking. Just moving forward like this was normal, like walking through underground tunnels carved beneath a city was something people did every day.

Which, I supposed, at T.A.I. they did.

The walls were close enough that I could touch both sides if I stretched out my arms. I didn't. Something about the texture of the stone, the slight dampness, made me want to keep my hands to myself. 

Water dripped somewhere ahead. The steady plip-plip-plip of it echoed, making it impossible to tell how far away it actually was. Could be ten feet. Could be a hundred.

I passed the first side tunnel. Colonel Thompson had said they all dead-ended, but I couldn't help glancing down it as I walked by. Darkness. Complete and total. The kind of dark that exists when you're underground with no natural light source for miles. The kind of dark that feels solid.

Don't think about it. Keep walking.

The temperature dropped slightly. Not much, but enough to notice. My breath didn't quite fog, but it was close. How far down was I now? Fifty feet? A hundred? More?

Another turn. Then another. The tunnel system felt deliberate, like it was designed to disorient. You couldn't walk straight for more than thirty seconds before the path curved again, always gently, never sharp enough to call a corner but enough that you lost all sense of direction.

Colonel Thompson had said fifteen minutes. I checked my watch, already seven minutes in. Halfway point coming up.

*Once you're past the halfway point, there's no good place to change your mind.*

I understood now. If I turned back at this point, I'd have to navigate all those curves again, in reverse, hoping I remembered which branches to ignore. And every second I'd be thinking about how I'd given up, how I'd let the tunnel beat me, how I'd have to call Dr. Ramcharan and explain that I couldn't handle a walk in the dark.

No. Forward was the only option now.

The tunnel widened slightly. Here, the walls were definitely hand-carved, rough stone, dark gray, with tool marks still visible. This section felt older, like it had been excavated first and everything else built around it. Natural cave system, maybe, that T.A.I. had found and expanded.

I passed another side tunnel. This one had a chain across it and a sign: "UNSTABLE - NO ENTRY." What the hell was down there? And why keep an unstable tunnel instead of sealing it?

Questions I'd probably never get answered.

Eight minutes. Nine. The sound of dripping water was closer now. I could see it ahead, a steady stream trickling down from a crack in the ceiling, forming a small puddle in a depression in the floor. I stepped around it, careful not to slip on the wet concrete.

The air smelled different here. Still that underground smell, but with a hint of something else. Machinery oil, maybe. Ozone. The smell of a place where work happened.

Ten minutes.

The tunnel began sloping upward. Subtle at first, then more pronounced. My calves started to feel it. How far down had I gone if it was taking this long to come back up?

Eleven minutes.

A sound ahead. Not dripping water. Something mechanical. A low hum, like generators or air circulation. The ambient noise that means civilization, systems, power.

Twelve minutes.

The LED strips were brighter here, closer together. The walls transitioned from rough stone to smooth poured concrete. Cleaner. More finished. The puddles disappeared. The air warmed slightly.

Thirteen minutes.

Around one more curve, and suddenly the tunnel opened into a small chamber. About twenty feet square, with a proper ceiling, proper lights, proper everything. It looked like someone had carved out a reception area in the middle of the earth.

And in the center of it stood an elevator.

Industrial. Reinforced steel doors. A control panel with biometric scanner. No floor numbers visible. Just a simple UP/DOWN indicator currently showing neither.

Dr. Anika Ramcharan stood next to it, holding her ever-present briefcase, looking exactly as composed as she had in the parking tower. Like underground chambers accessed through disorienting tunnels were her natural habitat.

"Fourteen minutes," she said, checking her watch. "Good time. Most people take seventeen on their first trip."

"It's not a race."

"Everything's a race." She pressed her hand to the biometric scanner. The elevator dinged softly and the doors slid open. "Ready to see what you signed up for?"

I stepped into the elevator. It was bigger than I expected, freight-sized, easily able to hold a dozen people or large equipment. The interior was brushed steel, clean and well-lit. Rubber floor for traction. Single control panel with cryptic labels: SUB-2, SUB-1, MAIN, LAB-1, LAB-2, ADMIN.

Dr. Ramcharan pressed her thumb to the scanner again and selected "MAIN."

The doors closed. For a moment, nothing happened.

Then we started moving up.

Smooth. Quiet. Nothing like the creaky industrial elevators I was used to. This was precision engineering, designed to move between levels without anyone noticing the transition.

My ears popped. We were ascending fast. Faster than seemed reasonable for an elevator.

"How far down was that?" I asked.

"The tunnel entry is at sub-level two. Approximately sixty feet below the garage. We're going to main level, which is about forty feet above sea level."

"So a hundred-foot climb."

"Roughly." She was watching me, evaluating. "The tunnel bothered you."

Not a question.

"It's designed to," I said. "Isn't it?"

A slight smile. "Very good. Yes. It serves multiple purposes. Security, obviously, difficult to force entry through a winding tunnel with no clear sightlines. But also psychological. If you can't handle fifteen minutes of discomfort, you won't last fifteen hours in a pressure situation."

"So it's a test."

"Everything's a test." The elevator hummed. "Those who turn back do so in the first three minutes or not at all. You didn't hesitate."

"I hesitated. I just didn't stop."

"That's the same thing."

The elevator chimed softly. The UP indicator went dark.

"Welcome," Dr. Ramcharan said, "to the Trinidad Aerospace Institute."

The doors opened.

I don't know what I expected. More concrete, maybe. More industrial darkness. More of the aesthetic of secrecy and underground operations.

What I got was light.

Natural light, pouring through skylights I shouldn't have been able to see from underground. Except we weren't underground anymore, Dr. Ramcharan had said forty feet above sea level. Which meant...

The main level was above ground. Hidden in plain sight.

The space beyond the elevator looked like a modern tech campus. Open floor plan, high ceilings, glass-walled offices and conference rooms along the perimeter. In the center, an atrium stretched up through multiple floors, with catwalks connecting different levels. Plants, actual living plants, hung from the walls and sat in planters between workstations.

And the workstations. Dozens of them, arranged in clusters. Large monitors, keyboards, prototyping equipment, 3D printers humming in the corner. Whiteboards covered in equations. People, actual people, moving between stations, talking, working, living their lives like this was normal.

The air smelled like coffee and electronics and possibility.

"You hid a research campus," I said slowly, "by making people think it was underground."

"We hid it," Dr. Ramcharan corrected, "by making the approach underground. Most of the facility is above ground, hidden behind various legitimate fronts. Light industry, warehouses, things that look boring from the street. But the only way in is through the tunnel. Forces commitment. Ensures discretion."

A woman approached us. Late twenties, athletic build, hair in a ponytail, wearing cargo pants and a t-shirt that said "ROCKETS ARE COOL" in block letters.

"You must be the new recruit," she said, extending a hand. "Gabriela Torres. People call me Gabi. I'm the systems integration specialist, which means when things break, I figure out why and fix them before Dr. Ramcharan finds out."

"I always find out," Dr. Ramcharan said mildly.

"Yeah, but sometimes not for a few hours, and that's basically the same as never." Gabi grinned at me. "Welcome to the chaos. You survived the tunnel, which means you're either brave or stubborn. We'll figure out which soon enough."

An older man joined us, gray beard, lab coat over a faded band t-shirt, holding a coffee mug that said "ROCKET SCIENTIST" with a small rocket diagram underneath.

"Dr. James Lal," he introduced himself. "Chief propulsion engineer. You're the blogger, yes? The one who wrote about calculating drift angles using real-time accelerometer data?"

"Uh, yeah. That's me."

"Brilliant piece. Absolutely brilliant. The way you explained phase space trajectories to an amateur audience, I've been teaching undergraduates for twenty years and never found a clearer way to convey that concept." He shook my hand enthusiastically. "I have so many questions about your methodology. Are you familiar with Lyapunov stability theory? Because what you were doing, whether you knew it or not, was- "

"James," Dr. Ramcharan interrupted gently. "Perhaps save the technical interrogation until after orientation."

"Right, right. Of course." He didn't look embarrassed, just excited. "We'll talk later. Oh, this is going to be fun."

A younger guy, probably my age, wandered over from a nearby workstation. He had multiple festival wristbands on both wrists and was wearing a soca band t-shirt under his open lab coat.

"Raj Patel," he said. "Materials specialist. Dr. Lal's assistant, theoretically, though mostly I just try to keep him fed and caffeinated while he does the actual genius work." He gestured around the facility. "Welcome to the best kept secret in the Caribbean. It's weird at first, but you get used to it."

"Do you?" I asked.

"No," he admitted cheerfully. "But you get better at pretending."

Dr. Ramcharan checked her watch. "I'm giving you to Raj and Gabi for the morning tour. They'll show you the accessible areas, get you set up with a workstation, start the NDA paperwork. This afternoon, you're with Dr. Lal in the lab for technical orientation. Tomorrow, we'll discuss your actual assignment."

"What is my actual assignment?"

She smiled. "That depends on what you notice today. Observation test. Pay attention."

Then she walked away, heels clicking on the polished floor, briefcase in hand, leaving me standing in the middle of a secret aerospace facility I'd only learned existed four days ago.

Gabi clapped me on the shoulder. "Don't look so terrified. It gets weirder before it gets normal."

"How much weirder?"

"Oh, you haven't even seen the restricted areas yet." She exchanged a glance with Raj. "Those are special."

Raj pulled a tablet from somewhere and tapped the screen. "Okay, so, official tour time. Questions as we go are encouraged. Getting lost is discouraged but happens to everyone at least once. Cafeteria is on level two. The coffee is good. The food is... adequate. Don't touch anything with a red warning label unless Dr. Lal explicitly says you can. Actually, don't touch anything with any warning label. Actually, maybe just don't touch anything for the first week."

"Helpful," I said dryly.

"I try." He grinned. "Come on. Let's show you where the magic happens."

We started walking through the main floor, weaving between workstations and equipment. People glanced up as we passed, curiosity, evaluation, a few welcoming nods. Everyone looked busy. Actually busy, not corporate-busy. The kind of busy that comes from working on problems that matter.

Somewhere in this building, they were building rockets.

And somehow, impossibly, I was part of it now.

I looked back at the elevator we'd emerged from. It stood there innocently, doors closed, giving no indication of the disorienting tunnel system that lay below.

Colonel Thompson had been right. The tunnel was unsettling.

But I'd made it through.

Now I just had to figure out if what waited on this side was worth it.

Gabi was talking about air handling systems and redundant power supplies. Raj was pointing out safety features and emergency exits. Dr. Lal was visible through a glass wall, already deep in conversation with someone about something that required aggressive gesturing at a whiteboard.

And through the skylights above, Trinidad's morning sun poured down like a spotlight on everything I'd chosen.

No turning back now.

Forward was the only direction left.
