**Time: 06:47 AM - 12:30 PM**  
**Supervisor: G. Torres, R. Patel**

"So the main floor is basically our open workspace," Gabi explained as we walked. "Most of the day-to-day engineering happens here. You've got individual workstations clustered by specialty, propulsion over there, avionics in that corner, structures and materials by the windows, systems integration where I usually camp out."

The space reminded me less of a traditional aerospace facility and more of a high-end tech startup, if tech startups built rockets instead of apps. Everything was clean but lived-in. Whiteboards covered in equations that had been erased and rewritten so many times the markers had stained the surface. Coffee cups at nearly every desk. A surprising number of plants.

"Dr. Ramcharan believes in biophilic design," Raj said, noticing my attention to the greenery. "Says it improves cognitive function and reduces stress. Also, it's nice. Not everything needs a peer-reviewed justification."

A woman in her mid-thirties looked up from a workstation as we passed. She resembled Dr. Ramcharan, same facial structure, same intense focus, but with softer edges. She was wearing jeans and a sweater despite the climate-controlled environment.

"That's Maya Chen," Gabi said quietly. "Computational dynamics lead. Runs all our trajectory simulations and orbital mechanics calculations. Basically, if you want to know where something will be in space, she can tell you down to the centimeter."

"Chen?" I asked. "But she looks like- "

"Dr. Ramcharan's younger sister," Raj confirmed. "Different last name because Maya got married. Small family operation in some ways. Though Maya earned her position, PhD in computational physics, worked at ESA before coming here."

Maya noticed us looking and waved, offering a warmer smile than her sister typically displayed. Then she went back to her screens, which were showing what looked like complex orbital trajectories.

We continued through the main floor. I tried to absorb everything at once, the layout, the people, the equipment, the general vibe of organized chaos that suggested serious work happening under casual surface.

"Conference rooms along the perimeter," Gabi pointed out. "Glass walls so Dr. Ramcharan can always see if people are actually working or just having meetings about meetings. She has opinions about meeting efficiency."

"She has opinions about everything," Raj added. "Most of them correct, which is annoying."

"Break room and cafeteria are up one level," Gabi continued. "We'll hit those later. Down one level is admin, HR, finance, legal, all the boring stuff that keeps us operating. Dr. Ramcharan's office is also down there, though she's rarely in it."

"Where is she usually?" I asked.

"Everywhere. Nowhere. It's unnerving." Raj shrugged. "She has this ability to materialize exactly when something interesting or problematic is happening. We suspect cameras everywhere, but honestly, I think she's just that good at reading the facility's energy."

We passed through a set of double doors into another section. The atmosphere changed immediately, less open workspace, more specialized lab environment. The lighting was different here, more focused. The air smelled like metal and chemicals and the particular ozone scent of electrical equipment running hot.

"The development lab," Gabi announced. "Dr. Lal's kingdom. This is where we test subsystems, validate designs, break things in controlled ways so they don't break in uncontrolled ways later."

The space was maybe five thousand square feet, filled with equipment I recognized and plenty I didn't. Test stands holding what looked like engine components. Chambers with thick glass windows. Rows of sensors and data acquisition systems. A small wind tunnel in one corner. Multiple workbenches covered in partially disassembled hardware.

Dr. Lal was there, naturally, examining something with a pair of calipers while talking to himself. Or possibly to the component. Hard to tell.

"He does that," Raj said. "Talks to the hardware. Says it helps him think through problems."

"Does it work?"

"He's solved three supposedly impossible propulsion challenges in the last four years, so we don't question his methods."

We moved through the lab, Gabi pointing out different testing stations and explaining their purposes. I recognized some of the principles from my blog work, thrust measurement, heat management, flow dynamics, but scaled up to industrial levels with equipment I'd never dreamed of using.

"You'll spend a lot of time here," Gabi said. "Everyone does, eventually. This is where theory meets reality and usually loses the fight."

At the far end of the development lab, I noticed something different. A section of wall that didn't match the rest. Where everything else was glass or painted drywall, this was reinforced steel. Heavy. Industrial. And set into it was a door.

Not a normal door.

This door was maybe eight inches thick, solid steel, with rubber seals around the frame and what looked like pressure indicators built into the surface. A biometric lock. Multiple warning signs: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. PRESSURE TESTING IN PROGRESS.

And next to the door, a small window. Maybe twelve inches square. But the glass, if it was glass, was matted, frosted, impossible to see through clearly.

I stopped walking.

"That's one of the restricted areas," Raj said, following my gaze. "There are four of them scattered through the facility. Different security levels, different access requirements."

"What's in there?"

"Depends on the room. That one's a high-pressure testing chamber. They run propellant flow tests in there, combustion stability experiments, things that could be... energetic... if they went wrong."

"Hence the explosion-proof door," Gabi added. "Eight-inch steel, rated for overpressure events up to about three atmospheres. The whole chamber is reinforced. If something goes boom, it stays contained."

I moved closer to the window. The matted glass scattered light in a way that made it impossible to see details, but I could make out shapes. Movement. Shadows of large equipment. Something that might have been a person in a protective suit.

"Can I go in?" I asked.

"Eventually, maybe. Depends on your assignment and clearance level. Some people work here for months without accessing the restricted areas. Others practically live in them." Raj pulled me away from the door. "But definitely not today. Come on, more to see."

We continued the tour. Up to the second level, where the cafeteria turned out to be a decent-sized space with actual windows showing, carefully curated, views of what looked like industrial Trinidad. The food stations were simple but well-stocked. The coffee, as promised, smelled excellent.

"We run 24/7 operations sometimes," Gabi explained. "So there's always food available. Midnight snacks are a legitimate line item in our budget. Dr. Ramcharan believes in feeding people properly. Hungry engineers make stupid mistakes."

A few people were scattered around tables despite the early hour. Some eating breakfast, others clearly finishing night shifts. The atmosphere was relaxed, conversational. Not the corporate cafeteria vibe where everyone stares at their phones. People were actually talking to each other.

"The team's pretty tight," Raj said, grabbing a cup of coffee. "Small enough that everyone knows everyone. We do monthly potlucks, Carnival crew goes to fetes together, that sort of thing. It's not just a job. Can't be, really, given the secrecy. We're kind of all we've got."

Back down to the main level, through another section I hadn't seen before. This area was more industrial, the factory floor Gabi had mentioned. The ceiling was higher here, maybe thirty feet, with overhead cranes and heavy equipment.

"Manufacturing and assembly," Gabi said. "Where we actually build the hardware. Wrench, sorry, Leonard Joseph, runs this section. He's old-school machinist, learned his trade before computer-controlled anything. But he can make parts to tolerances most modern machines can't match."

The space reminded me of the SpaceX videos I'd watched, similar layout, similar equipment, just scaled down. Large 3D printers for metal printing. CNC machines. Welding stations with proper ventilation. Composite layup tables. An autoclave for curing advanced materials.

And another restricted door.

This one was even more dramatic. Reinforced steel frame, pressure seals, multiple biometric locks. But the real tell was the airgap system, I could see the double-door setup, the kind used when contamination control matters. Or when what's inside needs to stay very, very separate from what's outside.

The matted glass window here was larger, maybe two feet square. I could see more through it, the vague outline of what might have been a clean room setup. Figures in white suits. Something large and cylindrical that could have been a fuel tank or pressure vessel or something else entirely.

"That's the materials processing lab," Raj said before I could ask. "Where we do specialized composite work and handle certain... sensitive... materials that require isolation. Temperature control, humidity control, positive pressure environment. Very expensive to maintain, very necessary for what we do."

"Which is?"

"Make rockets that don't explode." Raj grinned. "Usually."

"Usually?"

"I mean, sometimes we *want* them to explode. Controlled failures teach us things. But ideally not in the factory."

Gabi checked her tablet. "Okay, we're making decent time. One more area to show you before we throw you at the paperwork."

We took a different corridor, this one leading to what Gabi called the "nerve center", the computer core and simulation lab. Maya's domain, apparently, though the space looked like it served multiple purposes.

Server racks hummed along one wall, generating enough heat that the air conditioning was noticeably stronger here. Multiple workstations faced large displays showing various data visualizations, trajectories, weather patterns, orbital mechanics, things I didn't have context to understand yet.

The lighting here had a slight blue tint, easier on the eyes for long screen sessions. The furniture was all ergonomic, designed for people who spent twelve-hour shifts doing calculations.

And at the far end of this room, because of course, another restricted door.

This one was different. Less industrial, more... clean. Almost clinical. White walls around it instead of gray. The door itself was still reinforced steel, but the aesthetic was laboratory rather than factory. The matted glass window showed hints of blue light inside. Computer equipment, maybe. Or something else that glowed.

"Server room?" I guessed.

"Among other things," Gabi said, in a tone that meant she wasn't going to elaborate. "That area requires the highest security clearance. Even Dr. Lal doesn't have full access. Whatever's in there, it's above most of our pay grades."

"But you know what it is."

"I know some of what it is. Knowing everything would require need-to-know, and apparently, I don't need to know." She didn't sound bitter about it, just matter-of-fact. "That's how it works here. Compartmentalization. Everyone knows their piece. Very few people know all the pieces."

"Does Dr. Ramcharan?"

"Obviously. It's her facility." Raj started walking back toward the main floor. "Along with maybe two or three others. Colonel Thompson, definitely. Maya, probably. Everyone else gets read into what they need for their specific work."

We returned to the atrium, the bright central space where I'd first entered. The morning sun was higher now, pouring through the skylights, making the whole facility feel less like a secret installation and more like a place where normal work happened.

Except for those doors.

Four of them, scattered through the facility. Four matted glass windows offering glimpses of something I wasn't allowed to see yet. Four mystery boxes with biometric locks and warning signs.

And Dr. Ramcharan had said today was an observation test.

*Pay attention.*

"Paperwork time," Gabi announced, leading me to a small office off the main floor. "I know, I know, boring. But NDAs are serious business here. You're about to sign away your right to discuss anything you've seen, will see, or accidentally overhear in the bathroom."

The next two hours were exactly as tedious as promised. Reading dense legal language that basically boiled down to "don't tell anyone anything, ever, or we'll sue you into oblivion and possibly have you arrested." Page after page of non-disclosure agreements, security protocols, acceptable use policies, emergency procedures.

I signed everything. What else was I going to do at this point?

Raj set me up with a workstation in the main floor area, between the structures team and the systems integration cluster. My own desk, my own computer, login credentials, access to T.A.I.'s internal network.

"You're on the guest network for now," he explained. "Limited access. Can't see any classified project files, can't access the simulation systems, definitely can't open any doors that require biometric authentication. As you get read into specific projects, your access expands. Standard security practice."

"How long until I get full access?"

"Depends on the person. Some folks are here a year before they're fully cleared. Others, like Dr. Lal's previous assistant, got fast-tracked in three months because he was brilliant and trustworthy." Raj paused. "He left, though. Decided aerospace wasn't for him. Happens sometimes."

"Why'd he leave?"

"Couldn't handle the secrecy. Felt like he was lying to everyone in his life. That eats at some people more than others." Raj's expression was serious for once. "It's worth thinking about. What you're willing to trade for being part of this."

Before I could respond, Dr. Lal appeared with his characteristic enthusiasm.

"Ah! Perfect! You're set up. Good, good. Come with me. We have much to discuss." He was already walking back toward the development lab, assuming I'd follow.

I glanced at Raj, who just grinned. "Good luck. Remember, if he starts explaining something using tensor calculus, it's okay to ask him to back up. He forgets not everyone has three physics degrees."

Dr. Lal's version of "technical orientation" turned out to be a four-hour deep dive into T.A.I.'s propulsion research. He showed me engine components in various states of assembly, explained the theoretical basis for their current work, walked me through test data from recent experiments, and generally treated me like a graduate student he was personally mentoring.

It was overwhelming and exhilarating in equal measure.

"The fundamental challenge," he explained at one point, gesturing at a partially disassembled injector assembly, "is achieving stable combustion at the pressures and flow rates we need. Conventional wisdom says it's impossible with our mass constraints. But conventional wisdom is frequently wrong when you approach the problem from first principles."

"What's the mass constraint?" I asked.

"Ah! Good question. See, most rocket engines prioritize thrust-to-weight ratio. Bigger engines, more thrust, acceptable if they're heavy. But we're optimizing for a different variable. Can't tell you which one yet, that's classified, but it changes everything about the design space."

He showed me thermal management systems, exotic materials testing, computational fluid dynamics simulations running on Maya's computers. Every piece was fascinating. Every explanation opened up three new questions.

And through it all, I kept thinking about those doors.

Four restricted areas. Four pieces of the puzzle I couldn't see yet.

Dr. Lal had showed me the development lab, but certain experiments were clearly happening behind that pressure door. Gabi had shown me the factory floor, but the materials processing lab was off-limits. Maya's simulation center had that mysterious clean room with the blue light.

And I hadn't even seen the fourth restricted area yet. Somewhere in the facility, there was another sealed door, another window of matted glass, another piece of whatever T.A.I. was really building.

"You're distracted," Dr. Lal observed, not unkindly. "First day overwhelm, yes?"

"Just trying to understand what we're actually doing here. You've shown me engine components and test data, but I still don't know what we're building. What's the end goal?"

"The end goal," Dr. Lal said carefully, "is to make space access dramatically more efficient and economical. Beyond that, I can't say much until you're read into specific projects. But I can tell you this: what we're doing here, if it works, will change everything. Not incrementally. Fundamentally."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we've still learned things no one else knows, and we try again." He smiled. "That's the beauty of research. Failure is data."

The cafeteria at lunch was busier. I sat with Raj and Gabi, who introduced me to several other team members. Everyone was friendly but clearly evaluating me. The new person. The outsider. The one who needed to prove they belonged.

Isaiah "Zay" Williams turned out to be at the Trinidad facility for the week, up from his usual Tobago posting. Former helicopter pilot, now operating drones and test vehicles. He had that particular confidence of someone who'd looked death in the face professionally and decided it was interesting rather than terrifying.

"First day, yeah?" he said, sitting down with a loaded plate. "How you finding it?"

"Overwhelming. Exciting. Confusing."

"That's accurate for the first six months, honestly." He grinned. "Wait till you see the Tobago facility. That's when it gets real. Watching something you worked on actually launch, nothing else like it."

"When's the next test?" I asked.

"Couple weeks, maybe. Depends on weather and whether the current engine prototype passes validation." He lowered his voice slightly. "Between you and me, there's been some interesting developments in the restricted areas. Stuff that might move up the timeline."

Gabi kicked him under the table.

"Right, right. Need-to-know and you don't need to know yet. I forget." Zay didn't look apologetic. "You'll find out soon enough if you stick around."

After lunch, I was turned loose to explore on my own within the accessible areas. "Get familiar with the space," Gabi had said. "Tomorrow, the real work starts."

I wandered, trying to build a mental map. The facility was larger than it initially seemed, with the multiple floors and branching corridors creating a complex three-dimensional layout. Easy to see how people got lost.

I found the fourth restricted door almost by accident.

It was in a section of the facility I hadn't been shown on the official tour, down a corridor that connected the development lab to the factory floor. Not hidden, exactly, but not prominently displayed either. You'd only notice it if you were really exploring.

This door was different from the others.

No warning signs. No pressure indicators. Just clean reinforced steel with a single biometric lock and that now-familiar matted glass window.

I stepped closer, knowing I shouldn't but unable to resist. The glass scattered light in strange patterns, making it impossible to see details. But there was something in there. Movement. The suggestion of open space, maybe. And lights, bright lights, not the dim blue of computer screens or the harsh fluorescents of testing chambers. These looked almost like... daylight?

How could there be daylight this deep in the facility's interior?

"Curious?"

I spun around. Dr. Ramcharan stood there, having materialized from nowhere as promised. She didn't look angry, just mildly amused.

"Just exploring. Like Gabi suggested."

"And you found the fourth door. Interesting." She moved to stand beside me, looking at the matted glass. "What do you think is in there?"

"I have no idea. The other three make sense, pressure testing, materials processing, secure computing. But this one..." I gestured at the door. "No warnings. Different locks. And that light looks natural, which shouldn't be possible."

"Very good observation." She was pleased. "You're right. This room is different from the others. But I can't tell you why yet. Not until you're read into the project that requires it."

"When will that be?"

"Depends on how quickly you learn and how well you perform. Could be weeks. Could be months." She turned to face me fully. "Today was your observation test. What did you learn?"

I thought about it. Not just the physical facility, but the patterns, the implications, the things not said.

"You're compartmentalizing work deliberately," I said slowly. "Four restricted areas, probably corresponding to four different projects or four different aspects of the same project. Most people only access one or two. That way, if there's a security breach, the damage is limited."

"Continue."

"The facility is designed to look smaller than it is. The tunnel makes you think you're going deep underground, but we're actually mostly above ground. The approach is disorienting on purpose, makes it harder to know where you actually are relative to the city. And the legal fronts Gabi mentioned, the warehouses and light industry... you're hiding in plain sight. Nobody looks twice at boring buildings."

"What else?"

"The team is small. Maybe thirty people total? Forty? Small enough that everyone knows everyone, large enough to have specialists in every needed discipline. You're not trying to scale up production, this is a research and development operation. You're proving concepts, not building commercial vehicles."

Dr. Ramcharan smiled, the first genuine smile I'd seen from her. "Excellent. One more question. Why Trinidad and Tobago?"

I'd been thinking about that all day.

"Location is good for launches, close to equator, ocean to the east for safety. But that's not unique. Plenty of places have that." I considered. "The real reason is political, isn't it? Trinidad and Tobago is small enough that you can operate without excessive scrutiny, developed enough that you have infrastructure and skilled workers, but not so prominent on the world stage that foreign governments pay close attention to what happens here. You're below the radar."

"And?"

"And Dr. Ramcharan is from here. This is personal. You could have done this anywhere, but you chose home."

She nodded slowly. "You passed the observation test. Most people notice the equipment and the cool technology. You noticed the strategy. That's valuable." She started walking back toward the main floor, and I fell into step beside her. "Starting tomorrow, you'll begin actual project work with Dr. Lal's team. He'll assign you specific tasks, bring you into design reviews, let you get your hands dirty. Learn quickly. Prove yourself useful. Access follows performance."

"And the restricted areas?"

"One step at a time." We reached the main floor atrium. "You'll get home around six tonight, assuming no emergencies. The tunnel is less unsettling going back, you know what to expect. Same route, fifteen minutes. Colonel Thompson will scan you out."

"Do I come back tomorrow the same way?"

"Every day. Same route. It becomes routine eventually." She paused. "One more thing. You'll want to tell Marcus and Keisha about your first day. You can't. You can tell them you started work at an aerospace company, that it's interesting, that the people seem good. Nothing more specific. No location details, no names, no project descriptions. Can you do that?"

I thought about my best friends, waiting to hear how my first day went. Thought about editing my experiences down to meaningless generalities. Thought about the lies of omission I'd be telling for two years.

"I can do that," I said.

"Good." She turned to leave, then stopped. "You did well today. The tunnel, the observation test, the way you handled being thrown into everything, you're adapting faster than most. Keep that up."

It was the closest thing to praise I'd heard from her. I'd take it.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of technical documents and onboarding materials. By 5:45 PM, my brain was full and I was ready to leave. Raj showed me the exit procedure, biometric scan, confirmation from security, then the long walk back through those tunnels.

This time, as Colonel Thompson had predicted, they were less unsettling. I knew what to expect. The curves didn't disorient. The darkness between lights was just darkness. The whole thing took thirteen minutes instead of fourteen.

Still didn't like it, though. Don't think I ever would.

My Subaru sat exactly where I'd left it that morning, covered in slightly more dust but otherwise untouched. I got in, started the engine, that familiar sound, that familiar vibration, and pulled out of the hidden garage.

The evening city sprawled around me. Normal Port of Spain. People heading home from work, vendors closing up shops, traffic building toward the dinner hour chaos. The regular world, where rockets weren't built in secret and everyone could talk about their day.

My phone, charging on the passenger seat, buzzed with accumulated messages.

Marcus: *How was day one??? You survive???*

Keisha: *Tell me EVERYTHING. What's it like? What are you working on? Are there actual rockets?*

Marcus: *We're at the usual spot if you want to meet up. No pressure though, you're probably exhausted.*

I sat at a red light, watching the city flow around me, and typed out responses that felt like lies even though they technically weren't.

*Day one was good. Facility is impressive. People seem smart and dedicated.*

*Can't really talk about specifics, serious NDAs. But yeah, it's actual aerospace work.*

*Definitely exhausted. Rain check on meeting up? Tomorrow maybe?*

The responses came quickly.

Keisha: *NDAs make sense for aerospace. Glad it went well!*

Marcus: *No worries man. Get some rest. But also, you still have to show up to drift sometimes. Don't become too fancy for us.*

*Never. I'm still me.*

But was I? I'd spent one day at T.A.I. and already felt the distance growing. The secrets I was keeping, the things I couldn't share, the simple fact that a huge part of my life was now off-limits to the people I cared about most.

This was what I'd signed up for. This was the price.

I drove home through streets I'd known my whole life, but everything looked slightly different now. Like I was seeing it from the outside, from the perspective of someone who no longer quite belonged to the surface world.

Somewhere beneath Port of Spain, tunnels wound through bedrock, leading to a facility where people built impossible things. And tomorrow, I'd walk through those tunnels again, and the day after that, and the day after that.

Until either the secrets became comfortable or they broke me.

I hoped for the former. Suspected it might be the latter.

But either way, I was committed now.

Behind those matted glass windows, something waited to be discovered.

And I was going to find out what.
