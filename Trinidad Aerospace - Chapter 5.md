# Chapter Five: The Lab

**[T.A.I. Personnel File #2847 - Technical Orientation, Day 2]**  
**Date: August 24, 2043**  
**Time: 07:15 AM**  
**Clearance Upgrade: Level 2 (Provisional) - Project PROMETHEUS**

---

The second morning, the tunnel felt almost routine. Almost.

I made the walk in twelve minutes this time, my body already learning the rhythm of the curves, the spacing of the lights, the echo patterns of my footsteps. Colonel Thompson barely looked up when I biometrically signed in at the hidden garage. Just a grunt of acknowledgment and a wave toward the maintenance door.

Progress, I suppose.

Dr. Lal was waiting for me when the elevator doors opened onto the main floor. He had two cups of coffee and the manic energy of someone who'd probably been awake since 4 AM working on equations.

"Good morning, good morning! Excellent timing. We have much to do today." He thrust one of the coffee cups at me. "Drink. You'll need the caffeine. We're starting your technical read-in, and it's... well, it's quite a lot."

"Read-in?"

"Classification briefing. Project orientation. The part where we actually tell you what we're building." He was already walking toward the development lab, and I hurried to keep up. "Dr. Ramcharan approved your upgrade last night based on your observation test performance. You're being read into Project PROMETHEUS."

The name meant nothing to me, but the way Dr. Lal said it, with reverence and barely contained excitement, suggested it should.

We entered the development lab. It was quieter this morning, with only a few other people working at various stations. Dr. Lal led me to a glass-walled conference room in the corner that I hadn't noticed during yesterday's tour. Inside, Maya was already seated with a laptop, and Gabi was pulling up presentations on a large display screen.

"Close the door," Dr. Lal said. "Soundproofing activates automatically."

I did. The door sealed with a soft hiss, and suddenly the ambient noise from the lab disappeared completely. The silence was unsettling.

"Sit," Maya said, gesturing to a chair. Her manner was warmer than her sister's but still carried that same intensity. "What we're about to tell you is classified at the highest level within T.A.I. Only seventeen people have full access to this information. You're about to become the eighteenth."

I sat. My coffee suddenly felt very necessary.

Dr. Lal pulled up the first slide on the display. It showed a simple molecular diagram, just hydrogen atoms, but arranged in a lattice structure I didn't recognize.

"What do you know about metallic hydrogen?" he asked.

I searched my memory. "Theoretical form of hydrogen that exists under extreme pressure? Jupiter's core, maybe? Acts like a metal instead of a gas?"

"Correct! Excellent baseline." Dr. Lal's enthusiasm kicked into higher gear. "Under sufficient pressure, around 500 gigapascals, roughly five million times atmospheric pressure, hydrogen atoms are compressed so tightly that they form a crystalline metallic structure. The electrons delocalize, allowing electrical conductivity. It was first theoretically predicted in 1935, briefly created in laboratory conditions in 2017, and has been the subject of intense research ever since."

"Because it would make an incredible rocket propellant," I said, the pieces clicking together.

"The greatest rocket propellant theoretically possible using chemical reactions," Maya corrected. "The specific impulse, efficiency, basically, would be roughly 1700 seconds. Current best chemical rockets achieve maybe 450 seconds. We're talking about a propellant nearly four times more efficient than anything currently in use."

Gabi pulled up the next slide, showing energy density comparisons. The metallic hydrogen bar dwarfed everything else.

"The problem," she continued, "has always been stability. Create it under extreme pressure, and it instantly reverts to normal hydrogen gas when that pressure is removed. Decades of research, millions of dollars spent, and nobody could make it last more than microseconds at normal pressures and temperatures."

Dr. Lal was practically vibrating with excitement now. "Until eighteen months ago. When Dr. Ramcharan, using a novel approach combining carbon nanotube scaffolding with precisely calibrated electromagnetic field containment, successfully stabilized metallic hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for seventy-two hours."

The room went silent, letting that sink in.

"That's impossible," I said finally.

"That's what everyone said about heavier-than-air flight," Dr. Lal countered. "What everyone said about breaking the sound barrier. What everyone said about reaching orbit. Impossible just means nobody's figured out how yet."

Maya pulled up a video. It showed a small chamber, maybe the size of a water bottle, with something inside that gleamed like mercury but seemed to pulse with internal light. "This is a 50-gram sample of room-temperature stable metallic hydrogen. The first in human history. Created here, in Trinidad, in a facility the world doesn't know exists."

I stared at the screen. If this was real, if they'd actually achieved this- 

"This changes everything," I breathed.

"Everything," Gabi agreed. "Access to space becomes orders of magnitude cheaper. Mars missions become feasible with current technology. Asteroid mining becomes economically viable. The entire calculus of space exploration shifts."

"So why the secrecy?" I asked. "If you've solved this, why not announce it? You'd win Nobel Prizes. Dr. Ramcharan would be famous."

The three of them exchanged glances. Maya spoke first.

"Because the same properties that make metallic hydrogen the perfect propellant also make it an incredibly dangerous weapon. The energy density we're talking about, a kilogram of this contains more explosive potential than a kilogram of TNT. Much more. And unlike nuclear materials, it's not radioactive. Wouldn't trigger any existing treaty protocols or detection systems."

"If the major powers knew we'd achieved this," Dr. Lal continued, "they'd do everything possible to control it. Classified it under national security. Seize the research. Or worse, simply take it by force and claim they'd developed it independently."

"So Dr. Ramcharan came back to Trinidad," I said slowly, "to develop this outside the control of any major power."

"Precisely." Maya pulled up another slide, a map showing Trinidad and Tobago's location. "Small nation, not strategically important enough to draw major attention. Politically stable. Good infrastructure. English-speaking, highly educated workforce. But most importantly: neutral ground. Not aligned with any major power bloc. Perfect place to develop something that belongs to humanity, not to any specific government."

"Project PROMETHEUS," Dr. Lal said. "Named for the Titan who gave fire to humanity. We're giving humanity access to the stars."

Gabi activated the next section of the presentation. Technical diagrams, test data, photographs of equipment I now recognized from yesterday's tour. "The four restricted areas you noticed? Each one is part of the metallic hydrogen production and testing pipeline."

She walked me through them:

"Area One, the pressure chamber you saw in the development lab. That's where we generate the initial high-pressure conditions to create the metallic hydrogen. Extreme pressure, extreme temperature, very dangerous if something fails. Hence the explosion-proof doors."

"Area Two, the materials processing lab in the factory. That's where we create the carbon nanotube scaffolding and prepare the containment systems. Clean room environment because even microscopic contamination can destabilize the structures."

"Area Three, the secure computing area. Maya's specialty. We're running constant simulations of the electromagnetic field configurations needed to maintain stability. The computational requirements are massive, and the algorithms are proprietary. That room contains our most valuable intellectual property."

"And Area Four?" I asked.

They all smiled.

"That's the storage facility," Dr. Lal said. "Where we keep the stable samples. It requires constant electromagnetic monitoring and environmental control. The 'daylight' you noticed through the window? Full-spectrum lighting for the monitoring equipment. We need perfect visibility to catch any instability before it becomes critical."

"How much have you produced?" I asked.

"Total accumulated stable metallic hydrogen?" Maya checked her laptop. "Approximately 2.3 kilograms. Which doesn't sound like much until you remember that even 100 grams would provide enough propellant for a significant orbital maneuver."

Dr. Lal pulled up engine schematics. "Which brings us to what we're actually building. A rocket engine designed specifically to utilize metallic hydrogen propellant. Conventional engine designs don't work, the combustion characteristics are completely different. We're working from first principles, designing everything custom."

The designs were elegant. Compact, compared to traditional rocket engines, because the propellant was so much more efficient. Multiple redundant systems for safety. Exotic materials to handle the thermal loads.

"This is what I'll be working on?" I asked.

"Part of it," Gabi said. "Your background in real-time dynamic systems makes you valuable for the control algorithms. The engine has to respond incredibly precisely, millisecond-level adjustments to maintain stable combustion. Dr. Lal thinks your work on drift control theory translates well to propulsion system stabilization."

"It's the same mathematics," Dr. Lal added enthusiastically. "Keeping a car in a controlled slide versus keeping a rocket engine in controlled combustion, both are problems of managing instability at the edge of chaos. Your intuition for one applies to the other."

"When do we test it?" I asked. "The engine, I mean."

"Two weeks," Maya said. "That's the timeline. We have a prototype nearly complete. If the final validation tests go well this week, we'll transport it to the Tobago facility for a live fire test. Full duration burn, real metallic hydrogen propellant, actual flight conditions."

"And I'll be there?"

"If you prove yourself this week, yes." Dr. Lal stood, opening the conference room door. The sounds of the lab flooded back in. "But first, you have to understand the system you'll be helping to control. Come. Let me show you what we're actually building."

He led me out of the conference room to a workstation in the corner of the lab. The monitors showed complex simulation data, pressure curves, temperature gradients, combustion stability metrics.

"This is your station," he said. "For the next week, you'll be running simulations of the engine control system. Learning how the engine responds to different input conditions. Building intuition for the dynamic behavior. By the time we get to Tobago, you'll know this engine as well as you know your Subaru."

I sat down, looking at the screens full of data. A week ago, I'd been writing blog posts about car modifications. Now I was working on the control systems for an engine that used a propellant that technically shouldn't exist.

"Dr. Lal," I said. "What happens when you announce this? When PROMETHEUS becomes public?"

He smiled, but it was tinged with something like sadness. "The world changes. Space becomes accessible. But also, we lose control of it. Other nations will replicate our work, the theoretical basis is sound, they just need to know it's possible. They'll develop their own metallic hydrogen programs. Military applications will emerge. Someone will weaponize it, despite our best efforts to prevent that."

"So why do it at all?"

"Because keeping humanity on one planet is ultimately more dangerous than giving them the stars. Climate change, asteroid impacts, pandemics, civilization is fragile when it exists in only one place. This gives us redundancy. A chance to spread out, to survive." He put a hand on my shoulder. "The fire that warms can also burn. That's the Promethean bargain. But humanity has always chosen to take the fire anyway."

---

The rest of that day was a deep dive into propulsion theory unlike anything I'd experienced. Dr. Lal was a patient but demanding teacher, walking me through the mathematics of combustion stability, the materials science of engine design, the control theory that kept everything from exploding.

By lunch, my brain hurt.

By mid-afternoon, I was starting to see the patterns. The way pressure and temperature and flow rate all interacted. How the control system had to predict instabilities before they cascaded. How the entire engine was a carefully balanced system where every component affected every other component.

It was like drifting, actually. Reading the road, feeling the car's responses, making minute adjustments to maintain the perfect edge between control and chaos.

"You're getting it," Gabi observed, looking over my shoulder at one of my simulation runs. "Took Dr. Lal's last assistant three weeks to reach this level of intuition. You're doing it in six hours."

"I've been thinking about dynamic systems for years. Just in a different context."

"Context is overrated. The math is the math." She pulled up a chair. "Want to see something cool?"

She navigated to a different file, pulling up video footage. It showed the interior of one of the restricted areas, the pressure chamber, I guessed. In the center of frame was a compact engine, maybe three feet tall, mounted on a test stand.

"This is footage from three weeks ago. Our first successful full-duration burn with metallic hydrogen propellant. Ten seconds at 75% throttle."

She hit play.

The engine ignited with a sound that the microphone couldn't properly capture, too loud, too complex. But the visible result was unmistakable. A column of exhaust that glowed like captured sunlight, impossibly bright, impossibly hot. The thrust plume was shorter than a conventional rocket engine, more focused. More efficient.

And powerful. The test stand shook despite being bolted to the floor. The entire chamber vibrated.

Ten seconds later, it shut down smoothly.

"Four thousand pounds of thrust from an engine that weighs sixty pounds," Gabi said. "Thrust-to-weight ratio of over 65:1. Current best chemical rockets are maybe 150:1, but they're much larger engines. This is compact, efficient, and uses a propellant we can manufacture on-site."

"How much did that burn cost? In terms of propellant?"

"Eight grams of metallic hydrogen. Which took about forty hours to produce. We're still working on scaling up the production rate. It's the bottleneck right now, making it faster than we can use it."

I watched the video loop, that impossible bright plume. This was real. This was actually happening. In a secret facility in Trinidad, they'd solved one of aerospace's holy grail problems and built an engine to prove it.

"When this goes public," I said, "everything changes."

"Everything," Gabi agreed. "But first, we have to prove it works in real conditions. Hence Tobago. Hence the test in two weeks." She stood. "Keep running those simulations. Get familiar with every possible failure mode. When we're at the test site, there won't be time for questions."

That evening, as I drove home through Port of Spain traffic, my head was spinning with equations and possibilities. Metallic hydrogen. Room temperature stable. The key to affordable space access. Being developed in secret in the Caribbean.

My phone buzzed. Marcus.

*You alive? Haven't heard from you since Monday.*

I felt the familiar guilt. Two days at T.A.I., and already the distance was growing.

*Sorry man. New job is intense. Lots to learn.*

*That's cool. We're drifting Friday night if you want to join. Been too long.*

Friday. Could I even do that? Show up at the parking tower, pretend everything was normal, not mention that I'd spent the day working on propulsion systems for the most advanced rocket engine in human history?

*I'll try. Might be tired but I'll try.*

*That's all we ask. Don't become a stranger.*

Too late, I thought. I was already becoming a stranger. To them. To my old life. Maybe even to myself.

But I'd seen the video. The engine burning bright and clean and powerful. The future made visible in that ten-second test.

Some things were worth becoming a stranger for.

---

The rest of the week blurred together. Days spent running simulations, learning the engine's behaviors, absorbing everything Dr. Lal could teach me about propulsion theory. Nights spent trying to decompress, trying to maintain some connection to normal life, failing at both.

By Thursday, I could predict engine instabilities before they cascaded in the simulations. Could suggest control algorithm modifications that Dr. Lal actually implemented. Was starting to think in terms of thrust coefficients and combustion chamber pressures instead of horsepower and torque curves.

"You're ready," Dr. Lal announced Thursday afternoon, reviewing my latest simulation results. "Or as ready as anyone can be before their first real test. Tomorrow, we start physical preparations for the Tobago run."

"What does that involve?"

"Careful disassembly of the engine components. Secure transport preparation. Coordination with the Tobago facility team. And..." he smiled, "you'll finally get access to Area Four. We need to load the metallic hydrogen samples for transport. It's time you saw what you've been working with."

---

Friday morning, Dr. Ramcharan herself was waiting by Area Four's door when I arrived. Colonel Thompson was there too, along with Maya and Gabi. This was clearly an event.

"Before we open this door," Dr. Ramcharan said, "understand what you're about to see. That material inside represents two years of research, millions of dollars of investment, and quite possibly the future of space exploration. It's also incredibly dangerous if mishandled. You observe only. Touch nothing. Questions after we exit. Clear?"

"Clear."

She pressed her hand to the biometric scanner. Multiple locks disengaged in sequence. The door swung open silently.

The room beyond was flooded with light.

Full-spectrum LED arrays illuminated every surface. The space was maybe thirty feet square, with white walls, white floor, white ceiling. Clinical. Perfect. And in the center, on a specialized containment rack, were twelve transparent cylinders, each holding approximately 100 grams of material that looked like liquid mercury but gleamed with an inner luminescence.

Metallic hydrogen. Room temperature stable. Impossible made real.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Maya whispered.

It was. Not just the material itself, but what it represented. Every cylinder was a door opening to the stars. Every gram was a ticket to somewhere new.

The monitoring equipment lined one wall, electromagnetic field generators, temperature sensors, pressure monitors, automated safety systems. Everything needed to keep this miracle stable.

"We'll transport three cylinders to Tobago," Dr. Ramcharan explained. "300 grams total. More than enough for a full-duration test burn plus redundancy. The rest stays here, secured."

Colonel Thompson was already beginning the careful process of preparing the transport containers. Special cases, lined with field generators, monitored constantly. Nothing about this was casual.

"Monday morning," Dr. Ramcharan said, "we leave for Tobago. The team, the engine components, and three containers of the most valuable material on Earth. If everything goes according to plan, by Monday evening we'll have demonstrated a working metallic hydrogen rocket engine in actual flight conditions."

"And if something goes wrong?" I asked.

"Then we learn from it and try again." She looked at the gleaming cylinders. "That's how progress works. Calculated risks, careful planning, and the willingness to fail in pursuit of something that matters."

We stood there in the bright light of Area Four, surrounded by the impossible, preparing to make history in two days.

I thought about Marcus's text. The drift session I'd promised to attend. My old life that already felt distant and small.

I'd try to make it. But I knew, standing there, that something had fundamentally shifted. I wasn't the person who'd knocked on that garage door on Monday morning.

I was becoming someone else. Someone who worked with impossible materials to build impossible engines. Someone who kept world-changing secrets.

Someone who was part of Project PROMETHEUS.

The fire-bringer.

Ready or not, we were about to give humanity the stars.
