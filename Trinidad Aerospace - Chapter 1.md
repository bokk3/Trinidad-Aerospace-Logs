The thing about drifting in Trinidad is that you need to know where the cameras aren't.

I'd been documenting blind spots in the city's surveillance grid for three years on my blog, *Kinetic Vector*. Started as a physics project—calculating drift angles, posting breakdowns of weight transfer and momentum—but it evolved into something else. A map of freedom, basically. Places where you could push a car to its limits without some algorithm flagging you for reckless driving.

The parking tower on Ariapita Avenue was one of the good ones. Built in the '30s when parking was still an afterthought in urban planning, before every structure got wired with sensors and smart concrete. Twelve floors of open-air levels, the outer walls just waist-high barriers giving way to the Port of Spain skyline. During the day, it was half-empty. At night, it belonged to us.

I pulled my '39 Subaru—heavily modified, naturally—onto Level 7 around 2 AM. The engine's hum echoed off the concrete pillars, mixing with the distant sound of soca drifting up from a bar somewhere in the Woodbrook maze below. Through the open sides of the structure, the city sprawled out in layers: streetlights cutting through patches of darkness, and beyond that, the darker mass of the Northern Range, where jungle still claimed the steep hillsides.

Marcus was already there, leaning against his Honda, vaping something that smelled like mango and waiting with that particular kind of patience that meant he'd been scrolling through his phone for at least twenty minutes.

"Took your time," he said, not looking up.

"Traffic." There was no traffic at 2 AM, but it was the kind of lie that didn't need correcting.

"Keisha coming?"

"Said she might. Depends if she can sneak out." Keisha had the fastest car among us and the strictest parents, which felt deeply unfair on both counts.

Marcus pocketed his phone and walked a slow circle around my Subaru, the way he always did, like he was a mechanic doing an inspection rather than a friend who'd seen the same car a hundred times. "You finally install that new ECU?"

"Last week. Remapped the whole fuel system." I'd written about it on *Kinetic Vector*, included the full diagnostics and a video of the dyno results. Got about two thousand views, which for a niche blog about car modifications and underground street racing spots was pretty decent. Most of my readers were in Japan and California, places where car culture still had some teeth. Trinidad's scene was smaller, tighter. Everyone knew everyone.

"Let me see the post," Marcus said, already pulling his phone back out.

I waved him off. "Later. Let's make some noise first."

The plan was simple: a few runs around Level 7's perimeter, testing the limits of adhesion on turns we'd memorized. Nothing too wild—we weren't trying to end up on the evening news or in the harbor. Just enough to feel that perfect moment when physics and control intersect, when you're steering with the throttle more than the wheel.

I fired up the engine, let it growl, felt the vibration through the seat. Marcus got into position at the opposite end of the level. We'd start from different corners, cross paths in the middle, see who could hold their line better. Stupid, maybe, but that was part of the point.

I was halfway through my second lap, tires screaming as I swung wide around a pillar, when I noticed the third car.

Parked near the elevator bay. Dark sedan, European make, too clean for a place like this. No one just *parked* on Level 7 at 2 AM unless they knew what happened here. And if they knew what happened here, they either wanted to join in or stop us.

I eased off the accelerator, letting the Subaru coast to a stop near Marcus, who'd also noticed.

"Security?" he asked, voice tight.

"Wrong car for security." I killed the engine. The sudden silence felt heavy, broken only by the tick of cooling metal and the distant city sounds. "Besides, no lights flashing."

We sat there for a moment, watching the sedan. Its windows were tinted dark enough that I couldn't see inside, but I had the distinct feeling we were being watched. Evaluated.

Then the driver's side door opened.

She stepped out like she was arriving at a corporate board meeting, not a semi-legal drift spot in a concrete tower. Mid-thirties, maybe, wearing a charcoal suit that probably cost more than my engine modifications. Hair pulled back, briefcase in hand. She closed the car door with a precise click and walked toward us with the kind of confidence that comes from knowing exactly where you are and why.

Marcus swore under his breath. "Cop?"

"In a suit like that? And no backup?" I shook my head. "Something else."

She stopped about ten feet from my car, close enough to talk but far enough to respect the unspoken rules of street culture. When she spoke, her voice was clear, professional, with a Trini accent that had been smoothed by time abroad but never fully erased.

"You write *Kinetic Vector*," she said. Not a question.

I glanced at Marcus, who looked as confused as I felt. "Yeah. That's me."

"I've read all sixty-three posts. The analysis of weight distribution in modified drivetrains was particularly impressive. The post about using machine learning to predict tire degradation—that showed real insight."

"Thanks?" It came out like a question because I genuinely didn't know what else to say. People didn't usually track me down in person to discuss my blog.

She adjusted her grip on the briefcase. "My name is Dr. Anika Ramcharan. I'm the Director of the Trinidad Aerospace Institute." She paused, let that sink in. "And I'd like to offer you a position."

The words hung in the air between us, absurd and impossible. Aerospace? I wrote about *cars*. Street racing. Physics as a hobby, not a profession.

"I don't—" I started, but she held up a hand.

"I know what you're thinking. You're self-taught, no formal degree, just a blog and a modified Subaru. But that's exactly why I'm here." She took a step closer, and in the dim light of the parking tower, I could see she was completely serious. "The Trinidad Aerospace Institute doesn't need more academics. We need people who understand systems, who can solve problems in real-time, who think about physics not as theory but as something you *do*. You've been doing it your whole life."

Marcus leaned out his car window. "What exactly does the Trinidad Aerospace Institute do?"

Dr. Ramcharan's expression didn't change, but something in her posture shifted. A slight tightening, like she was deciding how much to reveal. "We develop next-generation propulsion systems. Rockets. Engines. The technology that will define the next era of space exploration." She looked back at me. "And we're doing it here, in Trinidad and Tobago, because certain types of innovation require... discretion."

"Discretion," I repeated. The word felt loaded.

"An apprenticeship," she continued, ignoring the implicit question. "Full training, full access to our facilities. You'll work with our engineering team, learn from people who've spent decades in the field. In exchange, we get your perspective. Your problem-solving. Your instinct." She pulled a card from her pocket, held it out. "Think about it. But not for too long. We're on a schedule."

I took the card. Heavy stock, minimal design. Just her name, a phone number, and a small logo I didn't recognize.

"How did you find me?" I asked.

For the first time, she smiled slightly. "You post from this location frequently. And you're not as invisible as you think." She turned back toward her sedan, then paused. "One more thing. If you accept, you can't write about it. No blog posts about T.A.I. Some things need to stay off the grid."

Then she got in her car and drove away, taillights disappearing down the spiral ramp, leaving Marcus and me alone on Level 7 with more questions than answers.

"Well," Marcus said finally. "That was weird."

I looked down at the card in my hand, then out at the city sprawling below. Somewhere out there, hidden in the jungle and the coastline, was a facility building rockets. And they wanted me.

My phone buzzed. A text from Keisha: *Sorry, couldn't make it. Parents locked the door. Next time?*

I typed back: *No worries. You didn't miss much.*

But that was a lie. I'd just been offered a door into something I didn't fully understand, something that existed in the gaps between the city I knew and the city I thought I knew.

I fired up the Subaru's engine again, but the sound felt different now. Smaller somehow. Like I'd been playing in a parking garage when somewhere else, people were reaching for the sky.

"You gonna do it?" Marcus asked.

I didn't answer. Didn't know yet. But I also knew I'd already started thinking about it, and once you start thinking about a thing like that, you're already halfway gone.

Above us, through the open walls of the tower, stars were beginning to fade as dawn crept up on the horizon. First light touching the jungle edges of the Northern Range.

And somewhere out there, in a facility I'd never seen, rockets were waiting.
