The ferry from Port of Spain to Scarborough took three hours. Three hours of open water, Caribbean sun, and growing anticipation mixed with exhaustion from the all-nighter.

Dr. Lal slept through most of it, sprawled in one of the passenger seats with his mouth slightly open, still clutching his coffee thermos even in sleep. Raj alternated between napping and scrolling through technical documents on his tablet, occasionally muttering about thermal expansion coefficients. I stood at the railing, watching Trinidad shrink behind us and Tobago grow ahead, three trucks secured in the ferry's cargo hold below.

The Gulf of Paria was calm, the water a deep blue that shifted to turquoise in the shallows. Fishing boats dotted the horizon. A few other passengers—tourists, locals, people living normal lives—moved around the deck, taking photos, buying snacks from the vendor cart.

None of them knew what was in those trucks. None of them could guess that sixty pounds of precisely machined metal in one of those cargo containers would, if everything went according to plan, reach the edge of space in less than forty-eight hours.

"First time to Tobago?" Maya appeared beside me, her own coffee in hand.

"Yeah. Never had much reason to go before."

"It's different from Trinidad. Quieter. More rural. But beautiful in its own way." She sipped her coffee, looking out at the water. "The test site is isolated. You'll understand why when you see it. We need the separation."

"For safety?"

"Partially. But also..." she hesitated, choosing words carefully. "There are aspects of PROMETHEUS we haven't told you about yet. Not because we don't trust you, but because they require seeing to believe. Tonight, after we arrive and get settled, there'll be another briefing. Dr. Ramcharan wants everyone on the same page before tomorrow."

"I thought I had the full picture. Metallic hydrogen propulsion, the engine, the test—"

"That's the foundation." Maya turned to face me directly. "But Dr. Ramcharan didn't spend seven years and all this money just to make rockets slightly more efficient. She's always thinking three steps ahead. What you've seen so far—the Trinidad facility, the engine development—that's step one."

"And step two?"

She smiled enigmatically. "You'll find out tonight. Just... keep an open mind. What we're about to show you is going to change your understanding of what we're doing here."

Before I could press for more information, Gabi's voice called from behind us. "Maya! Dr. Ramcharan wants you. Something about the Tobago facility reporting unusual activity."

Maya's expression shifted immediately from casual to alert. "What kind of activity?"

"Didn't say. Just said get down to the truck deck. Now."

We followed Gabi down the metal stairs to the vehicle deck, where the three trucks sat among other commercial vehicles, looking anonymous and ordinary. Dr. Ramcharan had set up a makeshift command post in the lead truck's cab, laptop open, satellite phone pressed to her ear. Colonel Thompson was there too, which was surprising—I hadn't realized he was on the ferry.

"When?" Dr. Ramcharan was saying, her voice controlled but tight. "And you're certain it was a drone?... No, don't engage. Just monitor and document. We'll be there in two hours." She hung up and looked at us. "We have a complication."

"What kind?" Maya asked, sliding into the truck's passenger seat.

"Zay spotted an unidentified drone conducting surveillance of the test site. Small, commercial-grade, but equipped with high-resolution cameras. It made three passes over the facility perimeter at approximately 7 AM this morning before leaving toward the northeast."

The temperature in the truck cab seemed to drop despite the tropical heat.

"Could be a coincidence," Gabi suggested, though her tone said she didn't believe it. "Lots of people use drones. Tourists, photographers—"

"At 7 AM on a Sunday morning?" Colonel Thompson's skepticism was sharp. "Flying systematic search patterns over what's supposed to be an agricultural research station in the middle of nowhere? That's not a tourist."

Dr. Ramcharan pulled up footage on her laptop—grainy but clear enough. The drone was indeed commercial-grade, probably a DJI or similar model. But the flight pattern was too methodical, too professional. It had conducted a complete perimeter survey, photographing every structure from multiple angles.

"Whoever's flying this knows what they're looking for," Colonel Thompson said. "They did a full reconnaissance sweep, took high-res photos of every building, then left. Professional intelligence gathering."

"Which government?" Maya asked quietly.

"Could be anyone. US, China, Russia, EU—anyone with satellite capability probably knows something is happening here. We've had construction activity, power consumption, vehicle traffic. But satellites can't see inside buildings or understand what we're actually doing. Hence the drone."

"Do we abort?" Wrench had appeared from checking on the cargo, his face serious. "Pack everything back up, go home?"

"No." Dr. Ramcharan's voice was firm, decisive. "We've come too far, and we need this test data. We always knew this moment would come—someone noticing, someone getting curious. We're just accelerating the timeline we already planned."

"How much?" Dr. Lal asked. He'd woken up and joined the group, instantly alert despite his earlier exhaustion.

"Tomorrow morning. First light. We'll work through the night if we have to, but I want the test complete before whoever sent that drone has time to organize a response."

"That's aggressive," Maya said carefully. "We haven't even unloaded yet. Integration alone is supposed to take two days—"

"Then we do it in twelve hours." Dr. Ramcharan closed the laptop with finality. "I've been preparing for this scenario for years. We're ready. The engine is proven. The team is capable. We just need to move faster than planned."

She looked at each of us in turn. "This is what we prepared for. Calculated risk becomes real risk. We prove PROMETHEUS works tomorrow, document everything, and then we control the narrative before anyone else can. Are we ready?"

Dr. Lal nodded first. "The engine is solid. If we can get it integrated and checked out, it'll work."

"Integration will be tight but doable," Wrench confirmed. "My team knows what they're doing."

"I can compress the pre-flight checks," Maya added. "We'll have to work through the night, but it's possible."

Gabi shrugged. "Recovery systems are already packed and ready. Just need to install them. I'm in."

Raj gave a thumbs up. "Sleep is overrated anyway."

Everyone looked at me.

"Control algorithms are loaded and tested," I said. "I'm ready."

Dr. Ramcharan allowed herself a small smile. "Good. When we dock, we move fast. Straight to the facility, no delays. Colonel Thompson coordinates security. I want eyes on every approach route. If that drone comes back, I want to know immediately."

She stood, straightening her jacket despite having spent the night in a truck. "Get some rest during the last hour of the ferry ride. Once we dock, it's going to be intense until the test is complete. Questions?"

No one had questions. We knew what needed to be done.

As the group dispersed, I stayed behind with Dr. Ramcharan for a moment. "Dr. Ramcharan? Are we sure about this? Accelerating everything because of one drone?"

She was quiet for a moment, looking out through the truck's windshield at the ocean. "Seven years ago, I left a successful career because I saw that certain types of innovation couldn't happen in the traditional system. Too much oversight. Too much control. Too many people who'd rather delay progress than accept risk." She turned to look at me. "I built T.A.I. because I believe humanity deserves better. Deserves access to the stars without having to ask permission from governments who'd rather keep that access for themselves. But that means working in the margins, in the spaces they're not watching. And it means being ready to prove what we've built before they can stop us."

"And if we fail?"

"Then we fail publicly, with our data available for others to learn from. That's still better than succeeding in secret and having it classified or suppressed." She picked up her briefcase. "But we're not going to fail. You proved that in Trinidad with the stability fix. We have the right team. The right technology. And tomorrow, we have the right opportunity. We're going to make history."

She walked away, leaving me alone in the truck cab with the weight of what was coming.

The ferry docked in Scarborough at noon. The midday heat was brutal after the ocean breeze—humid, pressing, the kind of heat that made you instantly sweat. We moved quickly, Colonel Thompson coordinating with port security to expedite our departure. The three trucks rolled off the ferry and onto Tobago's roads within fifteen minutes of docking.

"Stay tight," Colonel Thompson's voice came through the radio. "No unnecessary stops. Eyes open for any surveillance. We're exposed during transit."

I was driving the third truck again, with Dr. Lal navigating and Raj in the back with the equipment. We followed Dr. Ramcharan's lead vehicle through Scarborough—a small city, charming in its unhurried pace, tourist shops and local businesses mixed together—and then out onto the rural roads.

The landscape changed quickly. Urban gave way to agricultural—small farms, banana plantations, cocoa estates. Then that gave way to jungle. Dense, green, primordial. The roads narrowed, became rougher. We were heading inland, away from the developed coast.

"How much further?" I asked.

Dr. Lal checked his phone's GPS. "About thirty minutes. The facility is in the northeast part of the island. Deliberately isolated."

"Agricultural research station is the cover story?"

"Yes. We actually do some legitimate crop research—drought-resistant varieties, soil management. Enough real work to justify our presence if anyone asks. But the main facility..." he smiled. "That's something else."

The road became barely more than a track, requiring careful navigation around potholes and washouts from previous rains. The jungle pressed in from both sides, thick enough that you couldn't see more than a few meters off the road. Perfect natural camouflage.

"Turn coming up," Dr. Lal said. "Unmarked. Easy to miss if you don't know it's there."

The lead truck's brake lights flashed, and we turned onto an even smaller track that wound through breadfruit and coconut trees. The ocean was visible occasionally through gaps in the vegetation—we were close to the coast again, but on a remote, undeveloped section.

Then we emerged into a clearing.

The first thing I noticed was the view. We were on higher ground, looking down toward the Atlantic. The ocean stretched to the horizon, brilliant blue under the afternoon sun. To the south, I could see the developed parts of Tobago in the distance. But here, it felt like we were at the edge of the world.

The facility itself looked exactly like what it claimed to be. Several agricultural buildings—greenhouses, equipment sheds, a small administrative structure. Solar panels on roofs. A few tractors parked near one building. Completely plausible as a research station.

But past those buildings, hidden by careful landscaping and natural terrain features, I could see other structures. Larger. More industrial. And in a natural amphitheater formed by hills, a concrete pad that was definitely not for agricultural equipment.

"Welcome to the Tobago facility," Dr. Lal said. "T.A.I.'s best-kept secret after Trinidad itself."

We parked near the main building. Zay emerged from one of the structures, looking tired but energized. Former helicopter pilot turned whatever his role was here—he had that particular energy of someone who'd been working alone on a critical task.

"Glad you made it," he said as Dr. Ramcharan stepped out of her vehicle. "Been prepping all week. Everything's ready on our end. But that drone this morning—I got good footage of it if you want to review."

"Later," Dr. Ramcharan said. "Right now, we unload and start integration. I want the engine installed and preliminary checks done by midnight. Full system tests by 4 AM. Launch window opens at 6:15 tomorrow morning."

The team moved into action immediately. The trucks were unloaded with practiced efficiency, each component carried to its designated area. The metallic hydrogen containers went into a secure bunker with Colonel Thompson personally supervising. The engine components went to what Zay called the integration building.

I helped carry support equipment, getting my first real sense of the facility's layout. The integration building was climate-controlled and well-equipped—similar to the factory floor in Trinidad but scaled for this specific purpose. The control bunker was nearby, reinforced concrete with thick windows facing the launch area. The fuel systems, the safety equipment, everything needed for rocket testing.

"Larger than I expected," I said to Gabi as we carried a crate of electronics.

"Dr. Ramcharan doesn't do anything small. When she decided we needed a test facility, she built a real test facility. This place cost almost as much as the Trinidad lab." Gabi nodded toward the launch pad. "That pad down there? It's rated for vehicles ten times larger than what we're testing tomorrow. She's planning ahead."

By the time we finished unloading, the sun was starting to descend toward the western horizon. The afternoon light painted everything in gold—the jungle, the ocean, the facility buildings. It was beautiful and surreal, this combination of natural paradise and cutting-edge aerospace facility.

Dr. Ramcharan gathered everyone in the integration building's main bay. The engine components were laid out on work benches, ready for assembly.

"Listen up," she said. "We have roughly eighteen hours until the launch window opens. That's less time than we'd like, more time than we'd have in a real emergency. We're going to work in shifts—some of you on integration, some on pre-flight prep, rotating so everyone gets at least four hours of rest. Colonel Thompson has the security watch. If anything happens, he'll alert us."

She paused, looking at the engine components. "Tomorrow morning, we're going to test something that everyone said was impossible. We're going to prove that metallic hydrogen propulsion works in real flight conditions. And we're going to show the world that space access just became dramatically cheaper and easier."

"What happens after the test?" Raj asked. "I mean, assuming it works."

"Then we go public," Dr. Ramcharan said simply. "We release everything—the data, the methodology, the test footage. PROMETHEUS stops being a secret and becomes humanity's shared knowledge. But first, we have to prove it works."

She checked her watch. "It's 3 PM. Integration begins now. Let's make history."

The rest of the afternoon blurred into focused technical work. Wrench led the engine integration, his experienced hands guiding the team through each connection, each seal, each critical junction. Dr. Lal hovered nearby, checking specifications, running calculations, ensuring everything matched the design.

I worked with Maya on the control systems, loading the flight algorithms, testing communication links, verifying that every sensor and actuator responded correctly. The work was meticulous, repetitive, but essential. One loose connection, one misconfigured sensor, and the whole test could fail.

As the sun set over the Atlantic, painting the sky in spectacular colors, we worked under portable lights in the integration building. The engine was coming together, looking exactly as it had in Trinidad but somehow more real here, more purposeful.

"Taking shape," Wrench said with satisfaction as he torqued down the final mounting bolts. "Another two hours and we're ready to move it to the pad."

Dr. Ramcharan appeared with food—someone had made a run to a local restaurant, returning with containers of curry goat, rice and peas, roti, the familiar tastes of home even here at the edge of everything.

We ate quickly, taking shifts so work never stopped completely. The clock was ticking. Every hour brought us closer to dawn and the moment of truth.

"You should get some rest," Dr. Lal said to me around 8 PM. "The control system work is done for now. We need you sharp tomorrow for the actual flight."

"I'm okay. Not tired."

"You're running on adrenaline. When that fails, you'll crash hard. Go sleep for four hours. That's an order from your supervisor." He smiled. "Trust me, I've pulled enough all-nighters to know. Rest while you can."

He was right, of course. I found a bunk room in one of the support buildings—small but clean, with AC and proper beds. Raj was already there, somehow asleep despite everything.

I lay down, sure I wouldn't sleep, too wired from everything happening.

I was wrong. I passed out immediately and slept hard for exactly four hours, waking to someone shaking my shoulder.

"Time to get up," Gabi said. "It's midnight. Maya wants you in the control bunker for pre-flight system checks. The engine's on the pad."

I stumbled awake, splashed water on my face, and headed out into the tropical night.

The facility was lit up like a small city. Work lights everywhere, people moving between buildings with purpose. And down in the amphitheater, I could see it—the engine, installed on the pad, looking small and vulnerable under the stars.

Tomorrow morning, that engine would burn.

Tomorrow morning, we'd find out if PROMETHEUS was real or if we'd been chasing an impossible dream.

I headed toward the control bunker, ready for whatever came next.

But first, there was one more briefing. One more secret to reveal.

And according to Maya, it was going to change everything I thought I understood about what we were doing here.

Whatever came next was going to be bigger than I'd imagined.

Forward was still the only direction left.

But the destination was starting to look very different than I'd expected.
