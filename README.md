## Overview

*The Trinidad Aerospace Institute Logs* is a near-future science-fiction short set in 2043, where street-level ingenuity collides with a hidden Caribbean aerospace program.

A self-taught engineer documenting the physics of illegal night racing is quietly recruited into Trinidad’s most secret institution — an underground network of laboratories, launch facilities, and experimental propulsion systems concealed beneath jungle, concrete, and coastline.

From neon-lit garages to mist-filled rocket bays, this story explores what happens when raw problem-solving ability meets institutional secrecy, and when innovation demands both discretion and sacrifice.

Some stories start in parking garages and end on launch pads.
