The factory floor smelled like metal and possibility.

I'd spent all week in the development lab with Dr. Lal, living in the world of simulations and theory. Now, Friday morning, Gabi led me through the secure corridor to where theory became hardware.

"Different world down here," she warned as we approached the factory entrance. "The lab folks are scientists who think in abstractions. The factory crew are craftsmen who think in thousandths of an inch. Both are essential. Both speak different languages."

"Which language do I need to speak?"

"Today? Both." She pushed through the double doors. "You're going to help prep the engine for transport. That means understanding not just what it does, but how it's made and how it comes apart. Can't maintain what you don't understand."

The factory floor opened up before us—fifteen thousand square feet of organized industrial chaos. The ceiling soared thirty feet overhead, crisscrossed with overhead cranes and ventilation ducts. The space was divided into zones: machining along the left wall with CNC equipment humming, welding and fabrication in the center with bright flashes of arc welders, composite work near the far end with the distinct chemical smell of resins, and assembly stations throughout where components came together into systems.

And everywhere, people working. Not the quiet keyboard-focused work of the lab, but the loud, physical, hands-on work of making things. The sound was constant—machines running, tools clanging, the hiss of pneumatic systems, occasional bursts of compressed air, and underneath it all, the low rumble of the ventilation system working overtime to manage the heat and fumes.

A man stood at the nearest CNC machine, examining a freshly machined part with calipers. He was maybe late fifties, gray-haired, muscular despite his age, wearing oil-stained coveralls and safety glasses. He looked up as we approached.

"Wrench," Gabi called out. "This is the new recruit. Dr. Lal says he's ready to see the real work."

Leonard "Wrench" Joseph set down the calipers and looked me over with the practiced eye of someone who'd been evaluating apprentices for decades. He had the weathered hands of a man who'd spent his life working with metal and machines.

"You the blogger?" he asked in thick Trini dialect that Dr. Lal's academic English hadn't prepared me for.

"Yeah, that's me."

"You ever work with your hands? Real work, not just typing?"

"I build cars. Modify them. Rebuilt my Subaru's engine twice."

"Hmm." He picked up the part he'd been measuring—looked like some kind of injector component. "What tolerance you think this need to be?"

I took it, feeling the weight, examining the surface finish. "Fuel injector? For the metallic hydrogen engine?"

"Mhmm."

"Flow rate has to be precise. Any variation affects combustion stability. I'd say... plus or minus five thousandths?"

Wrench's expression didn't change, but something shifted. "Plus or minus *two* thousandths. This thing feeding propellant that cost more than my house per gram. Five thousandths and you get uneven flow, pressure spikes, maybe explosion." He took the part back. "But you were thinking right direction. Come, let me show you what we building."

He led us deeper into the factory, past the CNC machines and welding stations, to a clean area near the back where the engine assembly was happening. The prototype sat on a specialized stand—compact, elegant, maybe three feet tall and two feet in diameter. Nothing like the massive rocket engines I'd seen in videos. This was refined, efficient, every component clearly designed with weight and performance in mind.

"This the third-generation prototype," Wrench explained. "First one, we learned what don't work. Second one, we learned what almost work. This one—this one should work proper." He ran his hand along the engine bell. "Combustion chamber made from tungsten-rhenium alloy, best thermal properties we can get. Injector assembly—that's what I just machined—is titanium with ceramic coating. Whole thing weigh about sixty pounds but produce four thousand pounds thrust."

I moved closer, seeing the complexity. The plumbing alone was intricate—fuel lines, oxidizer lines, cooling channels, all precisely routed and connected. The control systems housed in a compact module. The gimbal mounting that would allow thrust vectoring.

"Dr. Lal showed me simulations all week," I said. "But seeing it like this..."

"Different when it real, eh?" Wrench smiled. "Paper can't catch fire. Computer can't explode. This—" he patted the engine, "—this can kill you if you don't respect it. That what make it real."

Over the next several hours, Wrench walked me through every component. Not the theory—Dr. Lal had handled that—but the practice. How parts were machined, what tolerances mattered and why, how to inspect for defects, the proper way to assemble and torque connections.

"Most young engineers, they come down here with their degrees and their computer models, thinking they know everything," he said at one point, showing me how to check surface finish with a profilometer. "They know the math, sure. But they don't know how metal behave under stress. Don't know that temperature affect everything. Don't know that you can hear when a bearing going bad before instruments show it."

"Experience versus theory," I said.

"No." He was firm. "Experience *and* theory. Both together. Dr. Lal, he brilliant man. Understand things I never could. But he also know he can't build this without people who work metal every day. That what make T.A.I. work—everybody respect what everybody else know."

A younger guy joined us—one of Wrench's machinists. He had a component that wasn't fitting properly.

"Boss, this cooling channel bracket, it no go in proper. Too tight."

Wrench took the part, examined it. "You check the thermal expansion coefficient? This going to get hot in operation. If it fit perfect at room temperature, it seize up when heated."

"Oh." The machinist looked embarrassed. "I thought the CAD model accounted for that."

"CAD model don't know what metal you using. Have to calculate yourself." Wrench pulled out a worn notebook from his pocket—actual paper, filled with handwritten calculations and charts. "Titanium expand 8.6 micrometers per meter per degree Celsius. Operating temperature going to be around 400 Celsius. You work out the clearance needed?"

The young machinist shook his head.

"That why you have problem." Wrench walked him through the calculation, showing him how to account for thermal expansion in the design clearances. It was the same kind of practical knowledge I'd learned working on cars—the stuff that textbooks don't teach because it seems too obvious to the experts.

Around noon, Dr. Ramcharan appeared on the factory floor. Unusual—from what I'd observed, she spent most of her time in meetings or in the restricted areas. Seeing her here, in coveralls instead of her usual suit, was jarring.

"How's the prep going?" she asked Wrench.

"On schedule. We start disassembly this afternoon, have everything packed by tonight. Should be ready for transport Monday morning."

"Good." She turned to me. "You're getting the full education, I see. Learning the difference between knowing and doing?"

"Very much so."

"Good. The test in Tobago—when things go wrong, and something always goes wrong on first tests—you'll need to understand the hardware well enough to troubleshoot in real-time. Simulations can't teach you that." She checked her watch. "Carry on. I want a full inventory check before anything leaves this facility."

She walked off toward the materials processing lab, leaving me with a growing appreciation for how hands-on she actually was. This wasn't a CEO who delegated everything. She knew what was happening at every level.

The afternoon was dedicated to carefully disassembling the engine for transport. Every component had to be documented, packed in specialized cases with foam padding and vibration isolation. Wrench supervised every step, his experienced eye catching issues that would have been disasters later.

"This seal here, see?" He pointed to a tiny o-ring. "Look good, yeah? But see this little mark? That from installation. Mean it been compressed wrong. In transport, it could set permanent. Then when we reassemble, it leak. Small thing, but small things kill you in rocketry."

He replaced the seal with a fresh one, documenting the change in his meticulously maintained logbook.

Maya showed up mid-afternoon with her laptop, checking measurements against the CAD models. "Everything within tolerance?"

"Everything perfect," Wrench confirmed. "Your models were good. Only two places we had to adjust for real-world fit."

"Which places?"

They went through the technical discussion, Maya taking notes, Wrench explaining how the physical reality differed slightly from the theoretical model. It was a conversation between equals—her mathematical precision complementing his practical experience.

By evening, the engine was packed in six separate cases, each labeled and inventoried. The metallic hydrogen transport containers were ready. The support equipment was catalogued. Everything needed for the Tobago test was accounted for.

"Good work," Wrench said to the factory team. "Monday morning, 6 AM, we load the trucks. Nobody be late. This too important."

The team dispersed, but Wrench gestured for me to stay.

"You did good today," he said. "Asked smart questions. Paid attention. Didn't pretend to know things you didn't." He pulled out a small machined part from his pocket—looked like a miniature rocket nozzle, maybe two inches long. "Made this during lunch. For you."

I took it. The surface finish was perfect, the geometry precise. A tiny work of art in aluminum.

"Why?"

"Reminder. This what we do here. We take ideas—crazy impossible ideas—and we make them real. Theory become metal. Dreams become hardware." He tapped the tiny nozzle. "Keep that. When you in Tobago, when things get stressful, remember—we already did the hard part. We made the impossible real. The test is just proving what we already know."

---

I left the facility around 8 PM, exhausted but satisfied in a way that the simulation work hadn't provided. My hands were dirty. My back ached. I'd spent the day actually building something, preparing hardware that would burn metallic hydrogen and push against the sky.

My phone showed messages from Marcus.

*You coming tonight? We at the tower, level 7*

I checked the time. Still early enough. I could make it.

*On my way. Give me 30 minutes.*

I stopped at home to change into proper drift clothes, wash the machine oil off my hands. The tiny nozzle Wrench had given me sat on my desk, catching the light. I picked it up, feeling the precise machining, the weight of it.

From blog post to rocket scientist in one week. The trajectory of my life had changed more dramatically than any drift angle I'd ever calculated.

The parking tower was exactly as I'd left it—same concrete, same graffiti, same view of Port of Spain spreading out below. Marcus and Keisha were there with a few other regulars from the scene. My Subaru felt familiar and strange at the same time, like putting on old clothes that didn't quite fit anymore.

"He lives!" Marcus called out. "Thought you'd forgotten about us, working for your fancy aerospace company."

"Never," I said, though we both knew it was partly a lie.

"So how's the secret rocket job?" Keisha asked. "Can you at least tell us if you're building cool stuff?"

"I can tell you it's interesting. Challenging. And the people are brilliant." All true. All missing the actual truth.

"That's it? That's all we get?" Marcus laughed, but there was an edge to it. "Man works on rockets and can't even tell his best friends what he's doing."

"NDAs are serious, Marcus. You know that."

"I know. Just miss having you around. Feel like we're losing you to the adult world."

We drifted for an hour, the familiar dance of car and physics. My Subaru responded like it always had, my muscle memory taking over. But my mind was elsewhere—calculating not just drift angles but combustion stability, not just tire adhesion but thrust vectoring.

When I came out of a particularly good run, Keisha was watching thoughtfully.

"You're different," she observed. "Not bad different. Just... different. Like you're thinking about ten things at once."

"New job brain," I deflected.

"No, it's more than that." She studied me. "You found something that matters to you. I can see it. Whatever you're working on, it's important."

"Yeah," I admitted. "It is."

"Good." She smiled. "Just don't forget where you came from. We're proud of you, you know. Even if we don't know exactly what we're proud of you for."

Marcus joined us, leaning against my car. "Seriously though, you okay? This job isn't like, stressing you out or anything?"

"It's intense," I said honestly. "But in a good way. Like everything I've learned, everything I've done—it all matters now. It's all leading somewhere."

"Where?"

I thought about Monday. The trip to Tobago. The test that could prove metallic hydrogen engines were viable. The moment when theory became demonstrated reality.

"Can't say yet. But trust me, it's going somewhere good."

We stayed until midnight, just hanging out like old times. But I could feel the distance. Not because of anything they did or anything I did. Just because I was carrying secrets, living in a world they couldn't access. The tunnel system beneath the city. The gleaming cylinders of metallic hydrogen. The engine that weighed sixty pounds and produced four thousand pounds of thrust.

When I finally headed home, I felt the weight of it. The cost of being part of something extraordinary.

My phone buzzed as I was parking. Message from Dr. Ramcharan.

*Monday, 5:30 AM departure. Bring work clothes and personal items for 2-3 days. We'll be staying at the Tobago facility through the test window. Don't be late.*

I replied: *I'll be there.*

Then I looked back toward the parking tower, where Marcus and Keisha were probably still hanging out, living their normal lives. Lives I used to be fully part of.

The tiny machined nozzle was in my pocket. I pulled it out, felt its precision.

Wrench was right. We were making the impossible real.

And on Monday, we'd prove it.

But standing there, alone in the dark, I wondered what else I'd make impossible. Normal friendships. A simple life. The ability to be fully honest with anyone outside T.A.I.

The Promethean bargain, Dr. Lal had called it.

Fire that warms also burns.

I went inside, set three alarms for 4:30 AM Monday, and tried to sleep.

Didn't work well. My mind kept running through everything—the engine assembly, the transport procedures, the test sequence. And underneath it all, the question I couldn't quite answer:

Was this worth it?

But I already knew the answer. Had known since I saw that video of the engine burning bright and impossible.

Of course it was worth it.

Had to be.

Because I'd already paid the price, and there was no refund available.

Forward was the only direction left.

Monday morning, Tobago, and the test that would change everything.

Ready or not, here we go.
