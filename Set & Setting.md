## TEMPORAL SETTING

**Year:** 2043  
**Season:** Late dry season transitioning to rainy season (August-September)  
**Time Period:** Most scenes occur at dawn (4-6 AM) or night (10 PM-3 AM)

**Technology Level:** Near-future. Electric vehicles are common but modified combustion engines still exist in street racing culture. Surveillance networks blanket cities but have exploitable gaps. Space exploration is active but still expensive and exclusive. AI assists with design work but human engineers are essential.

## TRINIDAD: PORT OF SPAIN & ENVIRONS

### **The Garage Tower (Ariapita Avenue)**

**Type:** Multi-level parking structure  
**Location:** East Port of Spain, near Woodbrook  
**Height:** 12 floors  
**Era:** Built in 2030s

**Physical Description:**
- Open-air design with no exterior walls, just waist-high concrete barriers
- Each level is approximately 200 feet by 150 feet
- Exposed to elements—rain, wind, heat
- Concrete pillars every 30 feet supporting the structure
- Spiral ramp system connecting floors
- Level 7 is the preferred drift spot (highest level with good sightlines, lowest camera coverage)
- Yellow painted parking lines long since faded
- Graffiti tags on support pillars (mostly street racing crews marking territory)
- Oil stains and tire marks everywhere on the upper levels

**Atmosphere & Lighting:**
- **Dawn:** Golden light filtering through, long shadows from pillars, the city waking up below
- **Night:** Sodium vapor lights (dim, orange-yellow glow), gaps of pure darkness between pools of light
- **Sound:** City noise echoes up—distant soca music, traffic, conversations from streets below. Wind whistles through the open structure. Engine sounds reverberate dramatically off concrete.

**View from Level 7:**
- West: Downtown Port of Spain, Queen's Park Savannah, scattered high-rises
- North: Northern Range mountains, dark jungle masses against sky
- South: Gulf of Paria in the distance
- East: Residential sprawl mixing with commercial zones
- Patches of jungle visible between buildings where vegetation reclaims abandoned lots

**Function in Story:** 
- Opening scene location
- Represents freedom, street culture, the protagonist's old life
- Public space being used for semi-legal purposes
- The "surface world" before descending into T.A.I.'s hidden realm

**Sensory Details:**
- *Smell:* Exhaust fumes, ocean salt on the breeze, sometimes food from nearby roti shops
- *Feel:* Concrete vibrations from cars, humid night air, occasional rain mist
- *Temperature:* Hot and sticky at night (28°C), slightly cooler at dawn
